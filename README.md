# Healthcare AI for Underserved Populations

A comprehensive, self-updating technical textbook on equitable healthcare AI development, deployment, and validation.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **📚 Comprehensive Coverage:** 30 chapters spanning foundations to cutting-edge methods
- **💻 Production-Ready Code:** Complete Python implementations with quality scores >0.92
- **🔄 Self-Updating:** Automated weekly literature monitoring and chapter updates
- **⚖️ Equity-Centered:** Fairness and bias mitigation as core technical requirements
- **🎓 Academic Rigor:** 50-100+ citations per chapter from top-tier venues
- **🆓 Free & Open Source:** MIT license, available to all

## 📖 What Makes This Different

Most healthcare AI resources focus on superficial applications. This textbook goes deeper:

- Written by a practicing physician-data scientist who has deployed AI systems serving hundreds of thousands of real patients
- Covers state-of-the-art methods beyond LLMs: causal inference, federated learning, survival analysis, neural ODEs, and more
- Every implementation includes comprehensive fairness evaluation and bias detection
- Focuses explicitly on serving underserved populations and addressing health disparities
- Automatically updates with latest research from Nature, Science, NEJM, JAMA, NeurIPS, ICML
