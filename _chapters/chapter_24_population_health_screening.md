## Introduction

Population health management represents a fundamental shift from individual patient care to systematic approaches for improving health outcomes across entire communities. While clinical machine learning often focuses on optimizing care for individual patients presenting to healthcare systems, population health applications must identify and reach individuals who may not be actively seeking care, design interventions that work at scale, and ensure that limited resources are allocated to maximize overall health benefit while prioritizing those with greatest need. This paradigm shift introduces unique technical challenges and profound equity considerations that distinguish population health ML from other healthcare applications.

The core tension in population health management lies between efficiency and equity. Traditional optimization approaches naturally gravitate toward "low-hanging fruit" interventions targeting easily reached populations with high expected response rates, but these efficiency-based strategies systematically disadvantage underserved communities who face greater barriers to participation and follow-through. A person experiencing housing instability may be identified as high-risk for hospital readmission but be unable to attend care management appointments or follow complex treatment regimens, leading efficiency-focused systems to deprioritize them in favor of more "compliant" patients. This creates a vicious cycle where those with greatest need receive least attention, perpetuating rather than reducing health inequities.

This chapter develops population health management approaches that place equity at the center of technical design rather than treating it as a constraint or afterthought. We present mathematical frameworks for need-based targeting that explicitly balance health benefit against intervention burden, screening strategies that account for differential participation rates across demographic groups, outbreak detection systems that ensure equitable surveillance coverage, resource allocation methods that prioritize vulnerability over predicted response, and causal inference approaches for evaluating distributional impacts of population interventions. Throughout, we emphasize that achieving health equity requires fundamentally rethinking optimization objectives, not merely adding fairness constraints to traditional efficiency-based formulations.

Population health applications span a wide range of use cases, each with distinct equity implications. Care management programs identify high-risk individuals for intensive intervention, but risk models trained on historical utilization data may systematically miss underserved patients who face barriers to accessing care in the first place. Screening programs aim to detect disease early when treatment is most effective, but differential participation rates mean that those who would benefit most from screening are often least likely to participate. Outbreak detection systems must balance sensitivity against false alarm rates, but surveillance gaps in underserved communities can delay recognition of emerging threats. Resource allocation decisions determine which clinics receive equipment, staff, or supplies, but optimization for efficiency may concentrate resources in affluent areas with better infrastructure rather than high-need communities with limited alternatives. Each application requires careful consideration of how technical design choices shape who benefits from population health efforts.

The mathematical foundations for population health management draw from several distinct areas of statistics and machine learning. Risk stratification builds on survival analysis and competing risks models, but must account for social determinants that mediate both disease progression and ability to engage with interventions. Screening optimization uses decision analysis and threshold selection methods, but must incorporate models of differential screening burden and participation across populations. Outbreak detection applies sequential change-point detection and spatial scan statistics, but requires understanding how surveillance infrastructure gaps create blind spots. Resource allocation employs operations research and optimization methods, but needs explicit equity constraints and vulnerability-based objective functions. Intervention evaluation relies on causal inference frameworks, but must go beyond average treatment effects to characterize distributional impacts and potential harm to subgroups.

This chapter integrates technical rigor with practical implementation guidance, providing production-ready code for building population health systems that measurably advance health equity rather than perpetuating existing disparities.

## Mathematical Foundations for Population Health

### Population Risk Stratification

Population risk stratification aims to identify individuals at high risk for adverse outcomes to enable preventive interventions, but the mathematical formulation of "risk" profoundly shapes who gets identified and how resources are allocated. Traditional risk models optimize predictive accuracy for outcomes like hospitalization or mortality, but this approach has systematic equity problems because it conflates risk of adverse health events with risk of healthcare utilization or documentation, privileging patients with better access to care and more complete health records.

Consider a standard risk stratification model for identifying patients at high risk of hospitalization within the next year. Let $$Y_i \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicate whether patient $i$ is hospitalized during the prediction window, and $$X_i$$ be a feature vector containing demographics, diagnoses, medications, and prior utilization. A logistic regression model estimates:

$$P(Y_i = 1 | X_i) = \sigma(\beta^T X_i)$$

where $$\sigma(z) = 1/(1 + e^{-z})$$ is the sigmoid function. Patients are ranked by predicted risk $$\hat{p}_i = \sigma(\hat{\beta}^T X_i)$$ and those above some threshold $$\tau$$ are enrolled in care management programs. This formulation has two critical equity problems. First, patients with better documentation will have higher predicted risks simply because their health problems are more comprehensively recorded, not because their underlying health is worse. A patient seen regularly at a well-resourced academic medical center will accumulate more diagnosis codes than an equally sick patient receiving sporadic care at an under-resourced community clinic. Second, the outcome $$Y_i$$ measures healthcare utilization rather than underlying health need - patients who lack insurance or transportation may be extremely sick but unable to access hospitalization.

A more equitable formulation distinguishes underlying health status from healthcare access and documentation quality. We can decompose the observed outcome as:

$$Y_i = H_i \cdot A_i$$

where $$H_i \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicates whether patient $i$ has a health condition severe enough to warrant hospitalization, and $$A_i \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicates whether they actually access hospitalization given their health status. In underserved populations, many patients have $$H_i = 1$$ but $$A_i = 0$$ due to barriers like lack of insurance, transportation, or proximity to hospitals. Standard risk models trained on $$Y_i$$ systematically underestimate risk for patients with low $$A_i$$, concentrating resources on those who already have good access.

To address this, we need models that estimate $$P(H_i = 1 | X_i)$$ rather than $$P(Y_i = 1 | X_i)$$, but $$H_i$$ is unobserved in standard claims or EHR data. This requires causal inference techniques to debias for differential access. One approach uses instrumental variable methods where geographic proximity to hospitals serves as an instrument for access conditional on health status. Another approach stratifies by measures of healthcare access (insurance type, usual source of care, prior utilization patterns) and applies inverse probability weighting to adjust for selection into observation.

A practical approach suitable for many settings employs composite outcomes that combine utilization with clinical indicators less dependent on access patterns. Instead of predicting hospitalization alone, we can predict $$Y_i^* = \max(Y_i^{\text{hosp}}, Y_i^{\text{ED}}, Y_i^{\text{lab}}, Y_i^{\text{decline}})$$ where:

- $$Y_i^{\text{hosp}}$$ indicates hospitalization
- $$Y_i^{\text{ED}}$$ indicates multiple emergency department visits
- $$Y_i^{\text{lab}}$$ indicates concerning laboratory values (elevated HbA1c, low eGFR, etc.)
- $$Y_i^{\text{decline}}$$ indicates functional decline measured by changes in vital signs or mobility

This composite outcome better captures underlying health status because laboratory values and functional measures are less dependent on healthcare-seeking behavior than hospitalization codes. However, even composite outcomes have equity issues if some components are more likely to be measured in certain populations.

The most robust approach incorporates social determinants and health equity indices directly into risk models, not as additional predictors but as explicit components of the outcome definition. We can define need-adjusted risk as:

$$R_i^{\text{need}} = P(H_i = 1 | X_i) \cdot V_i$$

where $$V_i$$ is a vulnerability index capturing social determinants that amplify the impact of health problems. For example, an elderly patient with diabetes living alone in a housing-unstable situation faces greater consequences from uncontrolled diabetes than an otherwise identical patient with strong family support and stable housing. The vulnerability index $$V_i$$ can incorporate:

- Social isolation (living alone, limited social support)
- Housing instability or homelessness
- Food insecurity
- Transportation barriers
- Limited English proficiency
- Low health literacy
- Multiple social needs

This formulation prioritizes patients who face greatest consequences from health problems rather than those most likely to utilize services, fundamentally reorienting the optimization objective toward need rather than predicted utilization.

### Screening Theory and Optimization

Screening programs aim to detect disease early when treatment is most effective, but screening decisions involve tradeoffs between benefits and harms that differ across populations in ways that can exacerbate health disparities. The mathematical framework for screening optimization must account for differential screening burden, varying prevalence across demographic groups, and inequities in follow-up care access.

Classical screening theory analyzes the population benefit from screening using a decision-theoretic framework. Let $$D \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicate true disease status and $$S \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicate screening test result (positive or negative). For a continuous test score $T$, the screening decision uses threshold $$\tau$$ such that $$S = \mathbb{1}(T > \tau)$$$. The operating characteristics of screening at threshold$$\tau$ are:

- Sensitivity: $$\text{Se}(\tau) = P(T > \tau | D = 1)$$
- Specificity: $$\text{Sp}(\tau) = P(T \leq \tau | D = 0)$$
- Positive predictive value: $$\text{PPV}(\tau) = \frac{p \cdot \text{Se}(\tau)}{p \cdot \text{Se}(\tau) + (1-p)(1-\text{Sp}(\tau))}$$

where $$p = P(D = 1)$$ is disease prevalence. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots sensitivity versus $$(1 - \text{specificity})$$ across thresholds, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) summarizes overall discriminative ability.

However, this framework ignores screening burden and assumes all false positives and false negatives have equal consequences across populations. In reality, screening burden varies dramatically. For a patient with reliable transportation, health insurance, and flexible work arrangements, undergoing screening and follow-up testing for a false positive is an inconvenience. For a patient working multiple hourly-wage jobs with no paid sick leave, uncertain immigration status, or significant caregiving responsibilities, the same process may be prohibitively burdensome or even dangerous.

A more complete framework incorporates screening burden explicitly into the utility function. Let:

- $$U_{TP}$$ = utility of true positive (early disease detection and treatment)
- $$U_{TN}$$ = utility of true negative (reassurance)
- $$U_{FP}$$ = utility of false positive (includes screening burden, anxiety, follow-up testing risks)
- $$U_{FN}$$ = utility of false negative (missed opportunity for early treatment)

Expected utility of screening at threshold $$\tau$$ for an individual is:

$$EU(\tau) = p \cdot [\text{Se}(\tau) \cdot U_{TP} + (1-\text{Se}(\tau)) \cdot U_{FN}] + (1-p) \cdot [\text{Sp}(\tau) \cdot U_{TN} + (1-\text{Sp}(\tau)) \cdot U_{FP}]$$

The optimal threshold $$\tau^*$$ maximizes expected utility:

$$\tau^* = \arg\max_\tau EU(\tau)$$

Critically, the utility values $$U_{TP}, U_{TN}, U_{FP}, U_{FN}$$ vary across populations based on screening burden, access to follow-up care, and treatment effectiveness. For populations facing high screening burden, $$U_{FP}$$ is more negative (false positives cause greater harm) and $$U_{TN}$$ is less positive (screening itself imposes costs even when negative). This means the optimal threshold $$\tau^*$$ should differ across populations - higher thresholds (requiring stronger evidence before screening positive) for populations with high screening burden.

Standard practice uses uniform thresholds across populations, which systematically harms those facing greater screening burden. Consider mammography screening where $$\tau$$ determines the threshold for calling a mammogram abnormal and recommending additional imaging. Using the same threshold for all women means that those who face transportation barriers, lack paid leave, or fear immigration consequences from medical contact experience greater net harm from screening because they endure the same false positive rate but face higher burden from follow-up.

An equitable screening strategy optimizes thresholds separately for populations with different burden profiles:

$$\tau_g^* = \arg\max_\tau EU_g(\tau)$$

where subscript $g$ indicates population group. This approach raises concerns about "different standards" for different groups, but the key insight is that groups already face different burdens - uniform thresholds mean uniform test characteristics but inequitable net benefit. Adjusting thresholds to equalize net benefit across groups is more equitable than maintaining uniform test characteristics.

The number needed to screen (NNS) provides an interpretable metric for comparing screening strategies:

$$\text{NNS} = \frac{1}{p \cdot \text{Se}(\tau) \cdot \text{RRR}}$$

where RRR is relative risk reduction from detecting and treating disease early. Lower NNS means fewer people need to be screened to prevent one adverse outcome. However, NNS alone is insufficient for equity analysis because it doesn't account for screening burden or differential treatment effectiveness. A better metric is number needed to screen to achieve net benefit:

$$\text{NNS}_{\text{net}} = \frac{1}{p \cdot \text{Se}(\tau) \cdot \text{RRR} - (1-p) \cdot (1-\text{Sp}(\tau)) \cdot h}$$

where $h$ is the ratio of harms from false positive to benefits from true positive. This metric accounts for false positive harms and provides a more complete picture of screening value.

Screening optimization must also address differential participation rates. Even if a screening strategy has positive net benefit at the population level, it exacerbates disparities if participation is lower among those who would benefit most. Let $$\pi_g$$ be the participation rate in group $g$. Population-level impact of screening is:

$$\text{Impact}_g = \pi_g \cdot [p_g \cdot \text{Se}(\tau) \cdot \text{RRR}]$$

If participation rates $$\pi_g$$ are lower in groups with higher prevalence $$p_g$$ (as often occurs in underserved populations), screening widens disparities even if it has positive benefit in participating individuals. This requires intervention strategies that actively reduce participation barriers rather than simply offering screening and assuming equal uptake.

### Temporal Outbreak Detection

Outbreak detection systems identify unusual increases in disease incidence to trigger public health response, but surveillance gaps in underserved communities create blind spots where outbreaks may go undetected. Mathematical approaches for outbreak detection must account for unequal surveillance coverage and differential reporting rates across populations.

The fundamental problem in outbreak detection is distinguishing signal (true outbreak) from noise (random variation in baseline disease rates). Let $$Y_t$$ be the count of disease cases observed at time $t$. Under the null hypothesis of no outbreak, $$Y_t$$ follows some baseline distribution, while under the alternative hypothesis of an outbreak starting at time $$\tau_0$$, there is an elevated rate:

$$Y_t \sim \begin{cases} \text{Baseline}(\lambda_0) & t < \tau_0 \\ \text{Outbreak}(\lambda_1) & t \geq \tau_0 \end{cases}$$

where $$\lambda_1 > \lambda_0$$. The goal is to detect the change point $$\tau_0$$ as quickly as possible while maintaining low false alarm rates.

The cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart is a classical sequential detection method that accumulates evidence of deviation from baseline. Define the CUSUM statistic:

$$S_t = \max(0, S_{t-1} + (Y_t - \mu_0 - k))$$

where $$\mu_0$$ is the expected count under baseline, and $k$ is a reference value (typically set to half the minimum outbreak effect size). An alarm is raised when $$S_t$$ exceeds threshold $h$. The CUSUM efficiently detects sustained increases in disease counts and provides control over average run length (ARL), the expected time to false alarm under the null hypothesis.

However, CUSUM assumes complete and uniform surveillance. In reality, disease reporting varies dramatically across populations. Underserved communities often have limited access to healthcare facilities where diagnoses are made and reported, leading to systematically lower baseline counts $$\mu_0^g$$ not because disease is less common but because it is less frequently diagnosed and reported. If we use the same CUSUM threshold $h$ across all communities, outbreaks in underserved areas require larger absolute increases to trigger alarms, creating delayed detection in populations that already face worse health outcomes.

An equity-aware CUSUM approach standardizes by population-specific baselines and adjusts for reporting rates. Let $$\rho_g$$ be the estimated reporting rate (proportion of true cases that are captured by surveillance) in geographic area $g$. We can adjust the CUSUM statistic to:

$$S_t^g = \max(0, S_{t-1}^g + \frac{Y_t^g - \mu_0^g}{\rho_g} - k)$$

This formulation upweights observations from areas with poor surveillance coverage, making the system more sensitive to changes in these communities. However, this also increases false alarm rates in low-coverage areas if reporting variability is higher, requiring careful calibration.

An alternative approach employs stratified thresholds that explicitly trade off detection speed against false alarm rates differently across communities. We can set community-specific thresholds $$h_g$$ to equalize expected time to detection for outbreaks of equal severity:

$$\mathbb{E}[\tau^g | \text{outbreak}] = c \text{ for all } g$$

where $$\tau^g$$ is the detection time in community $g$ and $c$ is a constant. This means accepting higher false alarm rates in underserved communities with poorer surveillance in exchange for comparable detection speed, which may be justified by the greater consequences of delayed outbreak response in these vulnerable populations.

Spatial scan statistics provide complementary approaches that detect geographic clusters of disease. The Kulldorff spatial scan statistic evaluates cylinders (circles on a map extended through time) and identifies clusters where observed case counts significantly exceed expected counts. For each potential cluster $Z$, the likelihood ratio is:

$$\Lambda(Z) = \left(\frac{c_Z}{E[c_Z]}\right)^{c_Z} \left(\frac{c_{\bar{Z}}}{E[c_{\bar{Z}}]}\right)^{c_{\bar{Z}}}$$

where $$c_Z$$ is observed cases in cluster $Z$, $$c_{\bar{Z}}$$ is observed cases outside the cluster, and $$E[\cdot]$$ indicates expected counts. The most likely cluster is the one maximizing $$\Lambda(Z)$$, and statistical significance is assessed via Monte Carlo simulation.

Spatial scan statistics have equity implications because they naturally detect clusters in areas with higher population density and better surveillance coverage. A cluster of 100 excess cases in a dense urban area with good healthcare access is more likely to be detected than a cluster of 50 excess cases in a rural area with limited healthcare facilities, even though the rural outbreak may represent a larger relative increase in disease burden. To address this, we can use population-adjusted scan statistics that weight by population size and vulnerability indices:

$$\Lambda^{\text{adj}}(Z) = V_Z \cdot \Lambda(Z)$$

where $$V_Z$$ is an average vulnerability index for cluster $Z$. This upweights clusters in vulnerable communities, increasing sensitivity to outbreaks in areas where consequences are most severe.

### Resource Allocation and Capacity Planning

Resource allocation in population health determines which communities receive limited resources like clinic capacity, public health nurses, or vaccination supplies. Traditional operations research approaches optimize for efficiency, but this systematically disadvantages underserved communities where infrastructure gaps mean lower expected returns per resource unit. Equity-focused resource allocation requires explicit optimization for need and vulnerability rather than predicted impact.

Consider a resource allocation problem where we have $R$ units of a resource (e.g., community health workers) to allocate across $G$ geographic areas. Let $$r_g$$ be the allocation to area $g$, subject to $$\sum_g r_g = R$$. An efficiency-based allocation maximizes total impact:

$$\max_{r_g} \sum_g I_g(r_g)$$

where $$I_g(r_g)$$ is the predicted impact (e.g., number of hospitalizations prevented) in area $g$ from allocating $$r_g$$ resources. This formulation naturally concentrates resources in areas where infrastructure already exists to support effective interventions, as $$I_g(r_g)$$ is higher in well-resourced communities.

An equity-based allocation instead maximizes weighted impact where weights reflect need rather than capacity:

$$\max_{r_g} \sum_g w_g \cdot I_g(r_g)$$

subject to constraints that ensure adequate coverage in all communities:

$$r_g \geq r_{\min} \text{ for all } g$$

The weights $$w_g$$ can incorporate multiple dimensions of need:

$$w_g = \alpha_1 \cdot \text{Disease burden}_g + \alpha_2 \cdot \text{Vulnerability}_g + \alpha_3 \cdot \text{Resource deficit}_g$$

where disease burden captures baseline prevalence and severity, vulnerability incorporates social determinants and healthcare access barriers, and resource deficit measures existing resource gaps relative to need. The coefficients $$\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$$ reflect value judgments about how to prioritize different dimensions of need.

An alternative formulation optimizes for equity directly by minimizing disparities in outcomes across areas:

$$\min_{r_g} \text{Var}_g[H_g(r_g)]$$

where $$H_g(r_g)$$ is the predicted health outcome (e.g., life expectancy, disease-free years) in area $g$ given resource allocation $$r_g$$. This minimax approach seeks to raise the floor, prioritizing improvements in worst-off communities over aggregate benefit.

Capacity planning for healthcare services must account for geographic access barriers that affect underserved populations disproportionately. The classic facility location problem determines where to place $K$ facilities to minimize average travel distance. Let $$d_{ig}$$ be the distance from individual $i$ to potential facility location $g$, and $$y_g \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicate whether a facility is placed at location $g$. The p-median problem minimizes total travel burden:

$$\min_{y_g, x_{ig}} \sum_i \sum_g d_{ig} \cdot x_{ig}$$

subject to:
- $$\sum_g y_g = K$$$(exactly$$K$ facilities)
- $$\sum_g x_{ig} = 1$$$for all$$i$ (each person assigned to exactly one facility)
- $$x_{ig} \leq y_g$$ for all $$i, g$$ (can only assign to open facilities)

This formulation minimizes average travel distance but ignores heterogeneity in travel burden. For someone with a car and flexible schedule, traveling 20 minutes versus 40 minutes is a minor inconvenience. For someone depending on public transit with multiple job responsibilities, this difference may determine whether healthcare access is feasible at all.

An equity-focused facility location approach weights travel burden by individual vulnerability:

$$\min_{y_g, x_{ig}} \sum_i v_i \cdot \sum_g d_{ig} \cdot x_{ig}$$

where $$v_i$$ is a vulnerability score capturing factors that amplify travel burden (lack of car, caregiving responsibilities, job inflexibility, etc.). This formulation places facilities closer to those for whom access barriers are most significant, even if it increases average travel distance.

Capacity planning must also consider temporal variation in demand and resource availability. Underserved communities often face "deserts" of healthcare access during evenings and weekends when family members are available to accompany patients to appointments. Queueing models can inform capacity planning decisions that account for these patterns. The M/M/s queue with time-varying arrival rates $$\lambda(t)$$ and $s$ servers provides a baseline model. Expected waiting time is:

$$W = \frac{P_0}{s \mu - \lambda(t)} \cdot \frac{(\lambda(t) / \mu)^s}{s! \cdot (1 - \lambda(t)/(s\mu))^2}$$

where $$\mu$$ is service rate and $$P_0$$ is the probability of zero customers in system. For populations with limited flexibility in timing, prolonged wait times effectively reduce access.

## Risk Stratification for Care Management

Care management programs provide intensive support to high-risk patients to prevent adverse outcomes like hospitalizations, but the process of identifying patients for these programs has profound equity implications. This section develops production-grade risk stratification systems that prioritize need over predicted utilization, incorporate social determinants throughout the modeling pipeline, and include continuous monitoring for equity drift.

### Comprehensive Risk Model Architecture

A production risk stratification system must integrate diverse data sources while remaining transparent and interpretable for clinical teams. We develop a modular architecture where separate components capture distinct risk dimensions, then combine them using interpretable aggregation rules.

This implementation provides a production-grade risk stratification system that addresses key equity concerns in care management targeting. The modular architecture separates clinical, social, and functional risk components to facilitate clinical interpretation and debugging. The vulnerability index explicitly captures factors that amplify health consequences, allowing the system to prioritize patients facing greatest overall risk rather than just highest predicted utilization.

### Continuous Equity Monitoring

Risk stratification models can drift over time as patient populations, care patterns, and data collection practices change. Equity drift is particularly concerning because models may gradually shift toward prioritizing patients from well-documented, easily-reached populations. Production systems require continuous monitoring to detect and correct equity drift.

This monitoring system provides continuous oversight of risk stratification equity, automatically detecting when disparities exceed acceptable thresholds and alerting system administrators to potential issues before they cause harm to underserved populations.

## Screening Strategy Optimization

Screening programs must balance benefits of early detection against burdens of screening and follow-up, with explicit consideration of how these tradeoffs differ across populations. This section develops screening optimization methods that account for differential screening burden and participation rates.

```

This screening optimization framework provides methods for determining screening thresholds that achieve equitable net benefit across populations, explicitly accounting for differential screening burdens and participation rates. The approach recognizes that equal test characteristics (uniform thresholds) lead to unequal burdens, and optimizes for equitable outcomes instead.

## Outbreak Detection and Surveillance

Infectious disease surveillance must balance sensitivity to detect outbreaks quickly against specificity to avoid false alarms, with explicit consideration of surveillance coverage gaps in underserved communities. This section develops spatial-temporal outbreak detection methods with equity-aware sensitivity calibration.

These outbreak detection methods explicitly account for surveillance infrastructure gaps and provide equity-aware sensitivity calibration to ensure that outbreaks in underserved communities are detected as quickly as those in well-surveilled areas.

## Conclusion

Population health management requires fundamentally rethinking optimization objectives to prioritize need over efficiency, explicitly accounting for differential barriers and burdens across populations. This chapter has developed mathematical frameworks and production implementations for risk stratification, screening optimization, outbreak detection, and resource allocation that place health equity at the center of technical design. The key insight is that achieving equitable outcomes requires more than adding fairness constraints to traditional formulations - it demands reconceptualizing what we optimize for and how we measure success.

Effective population health systems must integrate continuous equity monitoring, recognizing that even well-designed systems can drift toward efficiency-based targeting over time. The monitoring frameworks presented here provide automated oversight to detect equity drift before it causes harm. As population health management increasingly relies on machine learning and optimization, ensuring that these systems serve those with greatest need rather than those easiest to reach remains a central technical and ethical challenge.
