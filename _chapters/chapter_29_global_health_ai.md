# Chapter 29: AI for Resource-Limited Clinical Settings

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

1. Design healthcare AI systems that function reliably with limited computational infrastructure, intermittent connectivity, and constrained data storage, implementing model compression techniques, offline-capable architectures, and resource-adaptive algorithms appropriate for deployment in low-resource settings without compromising clinical utility.

2. Develop transfer learning frameworks that adapt models trained on data from high-resource settings to perform equitably in resource-limited contexts with different disease prevalence, clinical presentation patterns, and patient demographics, implementing domain adaptation techniques that account for distributional shift while avoiding performance degradation for underrepresented populations.

3. Build culturally and linguistically adaptive AI systems that work across diverse global contexts, implementing multilingual natural language processing, culturally appropriate risk communication, and participatory design approaches that center local knowledge and expertise rather than imposing external frameworks on local contexts.

4. Apply federated learning and privacy-preserving techniques that enable collaborative model development across institutions in different countries while respecting data sovereignty, implementing secure multi-party computation and differential privacy guarantees that protect sensitive health information from exploitation.

5. Implement participatory AI development processes that meaningfully engage local clinicians, community health workers, and patients as partners in system design and evaluation, ensuring AI systems address locally defined priorities rather than externally imposed metrics and that benefits accrue to communities providing training data.

6. Evaluate global health AI systems using equity-centered frameworks that assess not only clinical performance but also sustainability, local capacity building, alignment with local health priorities, and potential for perpetuating or challenging colonial patterns in global health technology development.

## 29.1 Introduction: Decolonizing Healthcare AI for Global Health

The global distribution of healthcare needs stands in stark contrast to the global distribution of healthcare AI development and deployment. Low and middle-income countries (LMICs), home to more than eighty percent of the world's population, bear an even higher proportion of the global disease burden yet receive only a small fraction of global health expenditure and account for less than five percent of clinical AI research. This profound mismatch creates both urgent need and substantial risk as healthcare AI expands globally.

The need is clear. Many LMICs face severe shortages of trained healthcare professionals, with sub-Saharan Africa averaging 0.2 physicians per 1,000 population compared to 3.2 in North America. In these contexts, AI systems that extend the capacity of limited clinical workforces could save millions of lives by enabling earlier diagnosis, more appropriate treatment selection, and more efficient allocation of scarce specialist resources. Diagnostic AI that helps community health workers identify tuberculosis in chest radiographs, predict preeclampsia risk from basic clinical data available in rural health posts, or screen for diabetic retinopathy using smartphone-based fundus photography represents potentially transformative applications for global health.

Yet the risks are equally clear and historically grounded. The history of global health is replete with examples of externally designed interventions that failed to account for local contexts, undermined local capacity, and perpetuated exploitative relationships between high-income and low-income settings. Healthcare AI risks replicating these patterns at unprecedented scale if systems developed primarily in high-resource settings are deployed globally without critical examination of their appropriateness, sustainability, and alignment with local priorities.

Consider the fundamental distributional mismatch. Models trained on data from academic medical centers in North America and Europe encounter populations with systematically different characteristics when deployed in LMICs. Disease prevalence differs dramatically—tuberculosis, malaria, and parasitic infections dominate infectious disease burden in many LMICs while remaining rare in high-income countries. Clinical presentation patterns vary due to differences in co-morbidities, nutritional status, treatment-seeking behavior, and timing of diagnosis relative to disease progression. Patient demographics skew younger in LMICs with higher fertility rates and lower life expectancy. Healthcare infrastructure differs fundamentally in available diagnostic tests, medications, specialist expertise, and follow-up capacity.

These differences mean that models trained on high-income country data may perform poorly when deployed in LMICs even when addressing the same clinical question. A sepsis prediction model trained on intensive care unit patients in Boston may fail when applied to febrile patients presenting to district hospitals in rural Uganda where malaria, typhoid, and other tropical infections are more common causes of similar clinical presentations. A diabetic retinopathy screening system calibrated to dilated fundus photography in ophthalmology clinics may perform poorly on non-dilated smartphone images captured by community health workers in remote areas.

Beyond technical performance, externally developed AI systems often fail to align with local health priorities and may inadvertently undermine local capacity. When technology companies from high-income countries deploy AI systems in LMICs while retaining data ownership, intellectual property rights, and algorithm control, they create dependencies that extract value from communities providing training data while offering little sustainable benefit. When AI development focuses on diseases that attract donor funding rather than addressing locally prioritized health needs, it perpetuates external agenda-setting in global health. When AI implementations require expensive proprietary hardware, reliable internet connectivity, or ongoing technical support from external vendors, they prove unsustainable when short-term funding ends.

This chapter develops approaches to healthcare AI for global health that center equity, sustainability, and decolonization as fundamental design principles rather than afterthoughts. We examine how to design AI systems appropriate for resource-limited settings that work with available infrastructure, limited training data, and constrained computational resources. We develop transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques that enable models to generalize across contexts while accounting for distributional differences. We implement federated learning approaches that enable collaborative model development while respecting data sovereignty. Most fundamentally, we explore participatory development processes that position local clinicians, community health workers, patients, and communities as partners who define priorities, contribute expertise, and maintain ownership rather than passive recipients of externally developed technologies.

The equity considerations in this chapter are not a separate section but woven throughout as fundamental design requirements. Every technical approach must be evaluated not only for clinical performance but for its potential to either challenge or perpetuate global health inequities. We ask repeatedly: Who benefits from this technology? Who owns the data and the resulting models? Who has the technical capacity to maintain and adapt the system? Whose priorities does the system serve? These questions guide our technical choices as much as accuracy metrics.

## 29.2 Infrastructure-Aware AI System Design

Resource-limited healthcare settings face fundamentally different infrastructure constraints than the environments where most healthcare AI is developed and tested. These constraints span computational resources, network connectivity, electrical power, data storage capacity, and technical support availability. Designing AI systems that function reliably despite these constraints requires explicit consideration of infrastructure limitations from initial architecture design through deployment and maintenance.

### 29.2.1 Computational Resource Constraints

Many healthcare facilities in LMICs lack the computational infrastructure assumed by modern deep learning systems. While academic medical centers deploy AI on servers with multiple GPUs and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM, community health centers in rural areas may have only basic computers or tablets. Mobile health implementations may rely entirely on smartphones or feature phones with severely limited computational capacity.

These constraints require rethinking standard AI architectures. Models with hundreds of millions or billions of parameters that achieve state-of-the-art performance in well-resourced settings become infeasible. We must instead design compact models that achieve acceptable performance within strict resource budgets through knowledge distillation, quantization, pruning, and architecture search optimized for edge deployment.

**Knowledge distillation** transfers knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a smaller student model by training the student to match the teacher's predictions rather than only the ground truth labels. The student learns to approximate the teacher's decision function using far fewer parameters. For healthcare applications, this enables training large models on data from well-resourced settings where computational resources are available, then distilling that knowledge into compact models deployable on resource-constrained devices in LMICs.

The distillation loss combines the standard supervised loss with a term encouraging the student's predictions to match the teacher's probability distribution:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{distill} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{CE}(y, f_{student}(x)) + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{KL}(f_{teacher}(x), f_{student}(x))
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{CE}$ is cross-entropy loss between predictions and true labels, $\mathcal{L}_{KL}$ is Kullback-Leibler divergence between teacher and student prediction distributions, and $\alpha$ weights the relative importance of these objectives. The temperature parameter in the softmax function for both teacher and student is often increased during distillation to create softer probability distributions that convey more information about the teacher's uncertainty.

**Quantization** reduces model size and inference time by representing weights and activations with lower precision. Standard deep learning uses 32-bit floating-point numbers, but many models maintain acceptable performance with 16-bit, 8-bit, or even binary representations. This dramatically reduces memory requirements and speeds inference on hardware supporting low-precision operations.

Post-training quantization applies quantization after training a full-precision model, mapping the continuous range of trained weights to discrete levels. Quantization-aware training includes quantization operations in the training loop, allowing the model to learn weights that remain effective after quantization by simulating quantization during forward passes while maintaining full-precision weights during backward passes.

**Network pruning** removes redundant parameters by identifying and eliminating weights that contribute minimally to model predictions. Magnitude-based pruning removes weights with small absolute values. Structured pruning removes entire neurons, filters, or layers rather than individual weights, creating genuinely compact models rather than sparse models requiring specialized inference libraries.

For healthcare applications in resource-limited settings, pruning strategies should explicitly consider the distribution shift between training data (typically from high-resource settings) and deployment contexts (resource-limited settings). Weights that seem redundant based on high-resource training data may be essential for generalizing to different disease prevalence and presentation patterns in deployment contexts. Stratified pruning evaluation that tests pruned model performance on diverse validation data from intended deployment settings ensures pruning does not disproportionately degrade performance for specific populations or clinical contexts.

**Neural architecture search for efficiency** automatically discovers model architectures optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency. Rather than searching only for maximum accuracy, multi-objective architecture search balances accuracy against model size, inference latency, and energy consumption. This identifies architectures achieving Pareto-optimal tradeoffs appropriate for different deployment constraints.

This implementation provides a complete pipeline for compressing healthcare AI models while maintaining equity. The system combines multiple compression strategies including knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from large teachers to compact students, quantization-aware training to learn weights that maintain performance at low precision, and structured pruning to remove redundant parameters. Critically, the evaluation framework explicitly tracks performance across demographic groups, ensuring compression doesn't disproportionately degrade performance for underrepresented populations.

### 29.2.3 Connectivity and Data Infrastructure

Network connectivity in resource-limited settings ranges from unreliable to nonexistent. Even when internet access is available, bandwidth may be extremely limited and costs per megabyte prohibitively expensive for users. These constraints require AI systems that function effectively offline while synchronizing efficiently when connectivity is available.

**Offline-first architecture** designs AI systems that perform all critical functions locally without internet connectivity. Models, data, and application logic reside entirely on local devices—tablets, smartphones, or computers in health facilities. The system remains fully functional when offline, with connectivity required only for optional features like model updates or data backup.

For diagnostic AI deployed in remote health posts, this might mean preloading model weights, reference data, and user interfaces on tablets distributed to community health workers. The tablets collect patient data, run AI models locally, and store predictions in local databases. When workers return to district hospitals with internet access, collected data syncs to central servers for aggregation and quality review while any available model updates download for future use.

**Efficient synchronization** minimizes data transfer when connectivity becomes available. Delta synchronization transmits only changes since last sync rather than complete datasets. Compressed representations use efficient encoding for medical data. Priority-based synchronization sends high-priority data first given uncertain connectivity duration.

**Progressive enhancement** allows systems to function at different levels of capability depending on available connectivity. Core diagnostic and treatment recommendation functions work completely offline. Enhanced features like accessing the latest clinical guidelines or obtaining specialist teleconsultation require connectivity but aren't essential for basic functionality. Users understand what features require connectivity and experience graceful degradation rather than failure when offline.

This implementation provides a complete offline-capable diagnostic system appropriate for resource-limited settings. The system performs all core diagnostic functions locally without internet connectivity, storing results in an efficient local SQLite database that requires no server infrastructure. When connectivity becomes available, the priority-based synchronization sends high-risk cases first, implementing delta sync to minimize data transfer. The architecture explicitly accounts for the constraints of resource-limited deployment including limited computational resources, unreliable connectivity, and minimal local infrastructure.

## 29.3 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation for Global Health

Models trained on data from high-resource settings often perform poorly when deployed in LMICs due to systematic distributional differences. Disease prevalence varies dramatically, with infectious diseases rare in high-income countries dominating morbidity in resource-limited settings. Clinical presentation differs due to varying co-morbidities, nutritional status, and healthcare-seeking behavior. Patient demographics skew younger. Diagnostic and treatment options differ based on local formularies and infrastructure. These differences create domain shift that degrades model performance unless explicitly addressed through transfer learning and domain adaptation.

### 29.3.1 Sources of Domain Shift in Global Health AI

Understanding the specific sources of domain shift between training and deployment environments guides appropriate adaptation strategies. We categorize domain shift into several types:

**Covariate shift** occurs when the input distribution differs between source and target domains while the conditional distribution of outcomes given inputs remains consistent. In global health, this manifests as differences in patient demographics, disease prevalence, and clinical presentation. A model trained on elderly patients in the US encounters much younger populations in sub-Saharan Africa. A tuberculosis detection system trained in low-prevalence settings faces much higher base rates in high-prevalence regions.

Under covariate shift, the conditional probability $ P(Y|X)$ remains constant but the marginal distribution $ P(X)$ changes: $ P_{source}(X) \neq P_{target}(X)$ while $ P_{source}(Y|X) = P_{target}(Y|X)$. This means the relationship between clinical features and outcomes is consistent, but the distribution of features differs. Addressing covariate shift often involves importance weighting or domain adversarial training.

**Label shift** (or prior probability shift) occurs when the distribution of outcomes changes while the conditional distribution of inputs given outcomes remains consistent. In global health, this manifests as dramatically different disease prevalence. The probability of tuberculosis given a certain set of symptoms and chest X-ray findings may be similar across settings, but the baseline probability of tuberculosis differs dramatically.

Under label shift: $ P_{source}(Y) \neq P_{target}(Y)$ while $ P_{source}(X|Y) = P_{target}(X|Y)$. Bayes' rule shows that when label shift occurs, we can reweight predictions based on the ratio of target to source label probabilities. If we know disease prevalence in both training and deployment settings, we can recalibrate model outputs accordingly.

**Concept shift** represents the most challenging case where the actual relationship between inputs and outputs differs across domains: $ P_{source}(Y|X) \neq P_{target}(Y|X)$. In global health, this occurs when the same clinical presentation predicts different outcomes due to systematic differences in populations or healthcare systems. A given set of vital signs might indicate higher risk in settings with limited treatment capacity. Co-morbidity patterns differ substantially between settings, changing how clinical features should be interpreted.

Concept shift often cannot be addressed without target domain labeled data for retraining or fine-tuning. Detecting concept shift is critical—deploying models under false assumptions of consistent relationships across settings creates substantial clinical risk.

### 29.3.2 Transfer Learning Strategies for Resource-Limited Settings

Transfer learning enables models to leverage knowledge from data-rich source domains when training data in target domains is limited. For global health applications, this typically means starting with models trained on large datasets from high-resource settings, then adapting them to resource-limited deployment contexts using smaller local datasets.

**Feature extraction** treats a pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor, using only the learned representations while retraining the final classification layers on target domain data. This approach requires minimal target domain data and computational resources since only final layers need retraining. For medical imaging, we might use a convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet or large medical imaging datasets as a feature extractor, then train a simple classifier on local data to predict relevant conditions.

The approach assumes that lower-level features learned on source data (edges, textures, basic shapes) remain relevant for the target task while only task-specific high-level reasoning needs adaptation. This holds reasonably well for medical imaging where basic visual features transfer across contexts, but may fail for clinical prediction where feature relationships differ.

**Fine-tuning** retrains all or most of the model parameters on target domain data, starting from weights pre-trained on source data rather than random initialization. This allows deeper adaptation to target domain characteristics while still benefiting from source domain knowledge. Fine-tuning typically uses lower learning rates for early layers (which encode more general features) and higher learning rates for later layers (which encode task-specific features).

For global health applications with very limited target domain data, careful fine-tuning strategies prevent overfitting while enabling sufficient adaptation. Strategies include progressive unfreezing (initially training only final layers, then gradually unfreezing earlier layers), discriminative learning rates (using different rates for different layer groups), and regularization that keeps parameters close to their pre-trained values.

**Domain adaptation** explicitly addresses distribution mismatch between source and target domains through techniques that make learned representations domain-invariant. Domain-adversarial training adds a domain classifier that tries to predict whether a sample comes from source or target domain based on learned features. The main model is trained to maximize domain classifier error, forcing it to learn features that work in both domains rather than source-specific features.

For global health, this enables training models that work across diverse clinical settings by ensuring representations don't encode site-specific artifacts. A chest X-ray model trained on data from multiple countries with different equipment learns to ignore equipment-specific image characteristics while maintaining disease detection accuracy.

This implementation provides comprehensive domain adaptation infrastructure appropriate for global health applications. The domain-adversarial training learns representations that predict disease outcomes accurately while being invariant to data source, enabling models to generalize across diverse clinical settings with different equipment, populations, and practices. The stratified evaluation framework explicitly tracks performance across domains, ensuring adaptation doesn't improve overall metrics while degrading performance for specific settings. The prevalence calibration function addresses label shift when disease prevalence differs dramatically between training and deployment contexts, a common challenge in global health where TB, malaria, and other diseases have radically different base rates across settings.

## 29.4 Multilingual and Culturally Adaptive AI Systems

Language barriers represent a fundamental challenge to equitable healthcare AI deployment globally. While most healthcare AI research and development occurs in English-speaking high-income countries, the majority of the world's population speaks other languages as their primary language. Even within multilingual countries, patients may have limited proficiency in official languages, particularly among rural, low-literacy, and marginalized communities. Clinical documentation, patient communication, and health education materials must work in local languages to be accessible and effective.

Beyond language, cultural context shapes how health and illness are understood, how symptoms are described, what treatments are acceptable, and how medical information should be communicated. AI systems that impose external cultural frameworks risk miscommunication, low uptake, and poor health outcomes. Culturally adaptive systems respect local knowledge systems, communication norms, and health beliefs while providing evidence-based care.

### 29.4.1 Multilingual Clinical Natural Language Processing

Developing clinical NLP systems that work in multiple languages faces several challenges beyond standard multilingual NLP. Medical terminology varies dramatically across languages, with many languages lacking standardized medical vocabularies. Clinical documentation practices differ across healthcare systems and cultures. Training data for clinical NLP is scarce in most languages beyond English, Chinese, and a few European languages.

**Cross-lingual transfer learning** enables leveraging English clinical NLP resources to build systems in other languages. Multilingual pre-trained models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa learn shared representations across languages, enabling zero-shot transfer where models trained on English clinical text can extract information from text in other languages without language-specific training data.

However, zero-shot transfer degrades performance substantially compared to language-specific training, particularly for specialized clinical terminology. Few-shot learning and active learning strategies improve performance with limited target language data by identifying the most informative examples for human annotation.

**Code-switching and language mixing** are common in multilingual healthcare settings where clinicians and patients may use multiple languages within single conversations or documents. A clinical note in India might mix English medical terminology with Hindi patient descriptions. Community health workers in Senegal might document cases mixing French and Wolof. Clinical NLP systems must handle this linguistic complexity rather than assuming monolingual text.

### 29.4.2 Culturally Adaptive Health Communication

Effective health communication requires adaptation to local cultural contexts, health literacy levels, and communication preferences. Culturally adaptive AI systems adjust language complexity, communication style, examples, and framing based on user characteristics and cultural context.

**Health literacy adaptation** adjusts medical information to appropriate comprehension levels. Patients with limited formal education or health literacy need simpler language, concrete examples, and visual aids. Systems must simplify without condescending, maintain clinical accuracy, and avoid assuming all patients need simplified communication.

**Cultural framing** presents health information using culturally appropriate metaphors, examples, and communication styles. Risk communication that works in individualistic cultures emphasizing personal control may fail in collectivist cultures emphasizing community and family. Discussions of sensitive topics like sexual health, mental illness, or end-of-life care require cultural sensitivity about what topics can be discussed openly and with whom.

**Community-informed content** develops health education materials through participatory processes with community members, traditional healers, and local health workers rather than imposing externally developed content. This ensures content addresses locally relevant health concerns, uses accessible language, and aligns with local cultural values.

This implementation provides a complete multilingual patient education system with cultural adaptation. The system translates health education materials while preserving critical medical terminology, adapts content for different health literacy levels, applies cultural framing appropriate for local contexts, and validates both medical accuracy and cultural appropriateness. Critically, the system acknowledges that automated cultural adaptation is preliminary only—true cultural appropriateness requires community review and participatory development with local experts and community members.

## 29.5 Federated Learning and Data Sovereignty

Collaborative model development across institutions in different countries faces substantial challenges around data sharing, privacy, and sovereignty. Many countries restrict health data export to protect citizen privacy and maintain control over valuable data resources. Institutions may be reluctant to share sensitive patient data with external entities due to privacy regulations, competitive concerns, or lack of trust in data governance. Yet individual institutions often lack sufficient data for robust model training, particularly for rare conditions or underrepresented populations.

Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Instead of centralizing data, models train locally at each participating site using local data. Only model updates (gradients or parameters) are shared with a central coordinator that aggregates updates to improve a global model. This architecture respects data sovereignty while enabling collective benefit from distributed data.

### 29.5.1 Federated Learning Architecture

The standard federated learning protocol proceeds iteratively:

1. A central server initializes a global model $\theta^{(0)}$
2. The server distributes the current global model $\theta^{(t)}$ to participating clients
3. Each client $ k $ trains the model on their local data for several iterations, computing updated parameters $\theta_k^{(t+1)}$
4. Clients send model updates $\Delta\theta_k = \theta_k^{(t+1)} - \theta^{(t)}$ to the server
5. The server aggregates updates to create an improved global model $\theta^{(t+1)}$

The most common aggregation strategy is Federated Averaging (FedAvg), which weights each client's contribution by their dataset size:

$$
\theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} + \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{n_k}{n} \Delta\theta_k
$$

where $n_k $ is the number of samples at client $ k $ and $ n = \sum_k n_k$ is the total.

For global health applications, participating clients might be hospitals in different countries, health ministries, or regional health systems. Each maintains complete control over their data while contributing to model improvement.

### 29.5.2 Privacy and Security Considerations

While federated learning avoids sharing raw data, model updates themselves can leak information about training data. Gradient-based attacks can reconstruct individual training samples under certain conditions. Repeated participation allows inference about sensitive attributes of the local population.

**Differential privacy** provides formal privacy guarantees by adding carefully calibrated noise to model updates before sharing. The amount of noise balances privacy protection against model utility. For healthcare applications requiring strong privacy guarantees, substantial noise may be necessary, degrading model performance.

**Secure multi-party computation** enables computing functions over distributed private inputs without revealing those inputs. In federated learning, secure aggregation protocols allow the server to compute the sum of client updates without seeing individual updates. This prevents the server from targeting specific clients while maintaining the ability to aggregate contributions.

**Homomorphic encryption** allows computations on encrypted data. Clients can encrypt model updates before sending to the server. The server aggregates encrypted updates and sends the encrypted global model back to clients for decryption. This provides strong privacy guarantees but introduces substantial computational overhead.

For resource-limited global health settings, the computational cost of advanced privacy-preserving techniques may be prohibitive. Practical deployments often rely on institutional trust, data use agreements, and selective aggregation rather than cryptographic guarantees.

### 29.5.3 Challenges in Global Health Federated Learning

Global health federated learning faces unique challenges beyond standard federated learning settings:

**Data heterogeneity** across sites is extreme. Disease prevalence, demographics, clinical practices, and data quality vary dramatically across countries and healthcare settings. Standard federated averaging can perform poorly when client data distributions differ substantially. Personalized federated learning approaches that maintain both global and local model components may be necessary.

**Resource heterogeneity** means participating institutions have vastly different computational capabilities, network bandwidth, and reliability. A federated learning protocol that works well for hospitals in high-income countries may be infeasible for resource-limited clinics with limited bandwidth and intermittent connectivity. Asynchronous federated learning that doesn't require synchronous participation and adaptive communication protocols that adjust to available bandwidth address these challenges.

**Unequal participation** creates power dynamics where large, well-resourced institutions dominate model development while smaller sites contribute minimally. This risks replicating colonial patterns in global health where high-income country institutions extract value from low-income settings. Fair aggregation strategies that prevent any single institution from dominating and equitable benefit sharing that ensures value flows to all contributors are essential.

**Local vs global benefit tradeoff** emerges when the globally optimal model performs poorly for specific populations. Federated learning typically optimizes a global objective, but sites care primarily about their local performance. Multi-task federated learning that maintains site-specific model components alongside shared components can help balance global and local performance.

This implementation provides a complete federated learning system appropriate for global health collaborations. The system enables institutions across countries to collaboratively train models while maintaining complete control over their data. Optional differential privacy provides formal privacy guarantees for sensitive health data. The aggregation strategies support both standard FedAvg (weighted by data size) and equal weighting that prevents large institutions from dominating. The comprehensive evaluation framework tracks performance across all participating sites, ensuring federated learning achieves equitable outcomes rather than optimizing for well-represented institutions at the expense of smaller or resource-limited participants.

## 29.6 Participatory AI Development and Community Ownership

Technical approaches to resource-limited deployment, domain adaptation, multilingual systems, and federated learning are necessary but insufficient for equitable global health AI. Fundamentally, we must address power dynamics in AI development: who defines problems, who designs solutions, who owns resulting technologies, and who benefits from their deployment. Without explicit attention to these questions, even technically sophisticated AI risks perpetuating extractive relationships where high-income countries and large technology companies develop systems using data from LMICs while value flows primarily to external actors.

Participatory AI development positions communities, local health workers, and patients as partners in system design rather than passive recipients of externally developed technology. Community ownership ensures benefits accrue to communities providing data. Local capacity building creates sustainable technical expertise rather than dependencies on external vendors. These approaches challenge colonial patterns in global health technology development.

### 29.6.1 Principles of Participatory AI Development

Participatory design has deep roots in Scandinavian workplace democracy movements and community-based participatory research in public health. Applied to AI development for global health, key principles include:

**Co-design from problem definition** engages communities in defining what problems AI should address rather than assuming external priorities. A technology company might prioritize diseases that affect wealthy markets. Communities might prioritize different health challenges, or non-disease factors like transportation barriers to care, stigma, or health system navigation. Co-design ensures AI addresses locally defined needs.

**Meaningful involvement throughout development** integrates community input across the entire development lifecycle, not only at the beginning (needs assessment) or end (user testing). Community members provide expertise about local context that shapes data collection protocols, feature engineering, fairness metrics, deployment strategies, and evaluation criteria. Their knowledge is valued as expertise, not extracted as data.

**Capacity building and knowledge sharing** transfers technical skills and builds local AI development capacity rather than creating dependencies on external vendors. Training programs develop local data science teams. Documentation uses accessible language. Open-source code enables local adaptation and maintenance. The goal is sustainable local capacity rather than indefinite external technical assistance.

**Data sovereignty and community ownership** ensures communities maintain control over their data and own resulting AI systems. Data use agreements specify permitted uses, prohibit commercial exploitation without community benefit, and require community consent for any changes. Ownership structures like community trusts or cooperatives maintain collective control. Intellectual property arrangements ensure communities benefit financially from any commercial applications.

**Equitable benefit sharing** distributes benefits from AI systems to communities providing training data. At minimum, communities receive free access to resulting systems. Ideally, communities participate in any revenue from commercial deployment through licensing fees, equity ownership, or profit-sharing arrangements. The extractive pattern where pharmaceutical companies test drugs in LMICs without ensuring access must not be replicated in AI.

**Accountability to community priorities** makes AI systems accountable to community-defined success metrics, not only external metrics. Communities define what performance levels are acceptable, what tradeoffs between different objectives are appropriate, and when systems should be modified or discontinued. Ongoing community governance structures maintain this accountability after initial deployment.

### 29.6.2 Implementation Considerations

Implementing participatory AI development in practice faces several challenges. Participatory processes take time and resources, potentially conflicting with pressure for rapid deployment. Ensuring diverse community representation requires explicit effort to include marginalized voices within communities, not only easily accessible community leaders. Language and technical barriers require careful attention to accessible communication. Power imbalances between well-resourced external AI developers and under-resourced communities require conscious effort to create genuinely collaborative relationships.

Successful participatory AI development requires sustained commitment, adequate resources for community engagement, flexibility to adapt based on community input even when this requires changing planned approaches, and willingness to share control and ownership. It cannot be an extractive process disguised with participatory language.

### 29.6.3 Case Study: Community-Owned Maternal Health AI in Rural Uganda

A consortium of rural health centers in Uganda, supported by a nonprofit technology organization, developed an AI system for predicting preeclampsia risk using basic clinical data available at community health posts. The project explicitly employed participatory methods and community ownership models.

Problem definition emerged from community health workers and traditional birth attendants who identified preeclampsia as a major cause of maternal mortality in their communities. Existing risk assessment tools required laboratory tests unavailable in rural health posts, limiting their utility. The community identified the need for risk assessment using only data collectable by community health workers during home visits: blood pressure, symptoms, medical history, and fundal height.

Data collection involved training community health workers in structured data collection using mobile phones. Rather than extracting data for external model development, the project established a community data trust where health centers collectively controlled data. Data use agreements specified that models trained on this data must be made freely available to participating communities, with any commercial licensing revenue split between the community trust (70%) and the nonprofit organization (30%) to support ongoing development.

Model development involved community health workers throughout. They provided expertise about which clinical features were reliably measurable in home settings versus requiring health facility visits. They identified relevant contextual features like transportation time to hospital, which proved predictive of outcomes independent of clinical risk. They participated in defining fairness metrics, specifically requesting stratified evaluation by distance from health facilities to ensure the model worked equitably for the most remote communities.

The resulting model used gradient boosted trees trained on features collectable during home visits. Performance exceeded existing risk scores requiring laboratory data when evaluated specifically on the population and setting of interest. Critically, performance was equitable across distance from facilities, age groups, and parity.

Deployment integrated the AI system into existing community health worker workflows using Android tablets with offline capability. Community health workers received training emphasizing that AI provides decision support, not autonomous decisions. The system flagged high-risk pregnancies for referral to health centers while providing guidance for all pregnant women. Community-defined performance metrics included not only clinical accuracy but also community health worker satisfaction, pregnant women's understanding of risk information, and timely referral completion rates.

Governance structures maintained community control. A community advisory board including health center representatives, community health workers, traditional birth attendants, and pregnant women's advocacy groups provided ongoing oversight. They reviewed quarterly performance reports and approved any model updates. When performance monitoring revealed the model underestimated risk for adolescent pregnancies, the community board approved data collection focused on adolescents and model retraining.

This example demonstrates participatory AI development in practice: community-defined problems, ongoing community involvement in development decisions, data sovereignty through community trusts, capacity building through training programs, and community governance ensuring accountability to local priorities. The system addressed a locally prioritized health need using AI appropriate for resource-limited settings while maintaining community control and ensuring benefits accrued to participating communities.

## 29.7 Conclusion: Toward Equitable Global Health AI

Healthcare AI development and deployment in resource-limited settings and LMICs presents both enormous potential and substantial risks. AI systems that extend the capacity of limited clinical workforces, enable earlier diagnosis, and improve treatment selection could save millions of lives, particularly in settings with severe healthcare workforce shortages and high disease burdens. Yet uncritical deployment of AI systems developed in high-resource settings risks performance failures, inappropriate technology choices, unsustainable dependencies, and perpetuation of extractive relationships between high-income and low-income countries.

This chapter developed technical and social approaches for AI development that serves rather than exploits underserved global populations. Infrastructure-aware design creates systems that function reliably with limited computational resources, intermittent connectivity, and constrained data storage through model compression, offline-capable architectures, and efficient synchronization. Transfer learning and domain adaptation enable leveraging knowledge from data-rich settings while adapting to different disease prevalence, clinical presentation patterns, and available diagnostic resources in resource-limited contexts. Multilingual and culturally adaptive systems work across linguistic and cultural boundaries while respecting local knowledge systems and communication preferences.

Federated learning enables collaborative model development across institutions in different countries while respecting data sovereignty and avoiding extractive data centralization. Most fundamentally, participatory AI development processes position local clinicians, community health workers, patients, and communities as partners who define priorities, contribute expertise, and maintain ownership rather than passive recipients of externally imposed technology.

The equity considerations throughout this chapter are not optional features but fundamental requirements. Assessing whether AI systems work equitably across diverse deployment contexts, different patient populations, and varying resource levels is as essential as assessing overall accuracy. Ensuring communities providing training data maintain data sovereignty and benefit from resulting systems addresses power imbalances in global health. Building local capacity for AI development, adaptation, and maintenance creates sustainability rather than dependencies. Centering community-defined health priorities rather than external agendas challenges the history of externally driven interventions in global health.

Technical innovation alone is insufficient. Achieving health equity through AI requires sustained commitment to justice, meaningful community engagement and ownership, willingness to challenge systems and structures that perpetuate disparate outcomes, and recognition that the goal is not merely deploying AI globally but ensuring AI serves populations who need it most while respecting their autonomy, protecting their rights, and centering their priorities.

The future of global health AI depends on whether we can move beyond extractive models that centralize data and value in high-income settings toward genuinely collaborative, community-owned approaches that respect data sovereignty, ensure equitable benefit sharing, and center the expertise and priorities of communities most affected by health disparities. The technical foundations developed in this chapter enable that future, but realizing it requires commitment to justice as fundamental as commitment to accuracy.
