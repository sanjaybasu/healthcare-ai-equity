## Introduction: The Multimodal Nature of Clinical Data

Healthcare is fundamentally multimodal. A single patient encounter generates structured electronic health record (EHR) data including vital signs and laboratory values, unstructured clinical notes documenting the provider's assessment, medical imaging from radiological studies, time-series physiological monitoring from bedside devices, genomic sequences, and audio recordings of heart sounds or patient-reported outcomes. This rich tapestry of complementary information holds tremendous promise for comprehensive clinical decision support, yet it also poses significant technical and ethical challenges.

Traditional machine learning approaches have largely focused on single modalities, training separate models for chest radiographs, clinical notes, or laboratory values. However, clinicians naturally integrate information across modalities when making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. A radiologist interpreting a chest X-ray considers the clinical indication documented in the ordering provider's note. An intensivist assessing hemodynamic stability combines vital sign trends with laboratory values and physical examination findings. This multimodal reasoning is not merely additive but synergistic, with information from one modality informing the interpretation of another.

The promise of multimodal learning in healthcare extends beyond improved predictive performance. By learning joint representations across data types, multimodal models can potentially identify novel disease phenotypes, detect subtle patterns invisible within single modalities, and provide more robust predictions when individual data sources are noisy or incomplete. Yet realizing this promise requires confronting several fundamental challenges. Healthcare data modalities have vastly different statistical properties: images are high-dimensional and spatially structured, text is discrete and sequential, laboratory values are low-dimensional and often missing, and time-series data exhibit complex temporal dependencies. Combining these heterogeneous representations in a principled manner requires careful architectural design and training procedures.

From an equity perspective, multimodal learning presents both opportunities and risks. On one hand, integrating diverse data sources may reduce reliance on any single modality that might be systematically biased or unavailable for certain populations. For instance, a model that can make reasonable predictions using either imaging or laboratory data provides flexibility when one modality is inaccessible. On the other hand, multimodal systems risk amplifying disparities if certain modalities are systematically unavailable in under-resourced settings. A model trained primarily on data from tertiary care centers with advanced imaging capabilities may perform poorly in community health centers where such imaging is unavailable. Moreover, the requirement for multiple modalities may create barriers to deployment in precisely the settings where clinical decision support is most needed.

This chapter develops the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of multimodal learning for clinical AI, with particular attention to the challenges of missing modalities and fairness across populations with differential data availability. We begin with core multimodal architectures and fusion strategies, then address the critical problem of missing modalities through both architectural innovations and training procedures. We develop interpretability methods specific to multimodal systems and establish evaluation frameworks that assess fairness not only across demographic groups but also across patterns of data availability. Throughout, we emphasize production-ready implementations suitable for deployment in diverse clinical environments.

## Mathematical Foundations of Multimodal Learning

Consider a clinical prediction task where we have access to $M $ different modalities. For a given patient $ i $, we observe data $\mathbf{x}_i = \{\mathbf{x}_i^{(1)}, \mathbf{x}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_i^{(M)}\}$ where $\mathbf{x}_i^{(m)}$ represents the data from modality $m$. Each modality lives in its own space: $\mathbf{x}_i^{(m)} \in \mathcal{X}^{(m)}$. For instance, in a clinical setting we might have imaging data $\mathbf{x}_i^{(1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}$ (a chest radiograph), clinical notes $\mathbf{x}_i^{(2)} \in \mathcal{V}^{L}$ (a sequence of tokens from vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$ of length $L$), and structured EHR data $\mathbf{x}_i^{(3)} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ (laboratory values and vital signs).

The goal of multimodal learning is to learn a function $ f: \mathcal{X}^{(1)} \times \mathcal{X}^{(2)} \times \cdots \times \mathcal{X}^{(M)} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ that maps from the joint space of all modalities to an output space $\mathcal{Y}$, such as disease diagnosis or mortality risk. The key challenge is that the modalities are heterogeneous: they have different dimensionalities, statistical properties, and semantic content.

### Modality-Specific Encoders

The first step in multimodal learning is encoding each modality into a common representational space. We define modality-specific encoders $\phi^{(m)}: \mathcal{X}^{(m)} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ that map raw modality data to fixed-dimensional embeddings. These encoders are typically deep neural networks whose architecture is tailored to the structure of each modality. For imaging data, convolutional neural networks extract spatial features. For text, transformer-based language models encode semantic content. For structured data, feedforward networks or graph neural networks (when relationships between features are known) produce embeddings.

Formally, for each modality $ m$, we compute an embedding:

$$
\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)} = \phi^{(m)}(\mathbf{x}_i^{(m)}; \theta^{(m)})
$$

where $\theta^{(m)}$ are the parameters of the encoder for modality $ m $, and $\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the resulting embedding. The choice of embedding dimension $d$ involves trade-offs: larger dimensions provide more representational capacity but increase computational cost and risk of overfitting, particularly when training data is limited.

### Fusion Strategies

Once we have embeddings for each modality, we must combine them to make predictions. The multimodal fusion strategy determines how information is integrated across modalities. There are three primary approaches: early fusion, late fusion, and intermediate fusion.

**Early Fusion** concatenates raw or lightly processed features from all modalities before learning a joint representation:

$$
\mathbf{h}_i = \psi([\mathbf{x}_i^{(1)}, \mathbf{x}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_i^{(M)}]; \theta_{\text{fusion}})
$$

where $[\cdot]$ denotes concatenation (or another combining operation), and $\psi$ is a joint model that processes all modalities simultaneously. Early fusion allows the model to learn low-level cross-modal interactions but requires all modalities to be available during training and inference. In clinical settings, this can be problematic as the concatenation of a high-resolution image with a short text note creates imbalanced inputs.

**Late Fusion** processes each modality independently through modality-specific models, then combines their predictions:

$$
\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)} = \phi^{(m)}(\mathbf{x}_i^{(m)}; \theta^{(m)})
$$

$$
\hat{y}_i^{(m)} = g^{(m)}(\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)}; \theta_g^{(m)})
$$

$$
\hat{y}_i = \text{Aggregate}(\{\hat{y}_i^{(1)}, \hat{y}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \hat{y}_i^{(M)}\})
$$

where $g^{(m)}$ is a prediction head for modality $ m$, and the aggregation function might be averaging, voting, or a learned weighted combination. Late fusion is robust to missing modalities since each modality produces an independent prediction, but it cannot capture cross-modal interactions that may be clinically important. For instance, a late fusion model cannot learn that certain imaging findings are particularly concerning in the context of specific laboratory abnormalities.

**Intermediate Fusion** strikes a balance by learning modality-specific encoders, then fusing their embeddings to learn joint representations:

$$
\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)} = \phi^{(m)}(\mathbf{x}_i^{(m)}; \theta^{(m)})
$$

$$
\mathbf{h}_i = \psi([\mathbf{z}_i^{(1)}, \mathbf{z}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{z}_i^{(M)}]; \theta_{\text{fusion}})
$$

$$
\hat{y}_i = g(\mathbf{h}_i; \theta_g)
$$

This approach allows learning both modality-specific representations and cross-modal interactions while providing some flexibility when modalities are missing, though typically requiring additional strategies to handle missing data robustly.

### Attention-Based Fusion

Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal fusion, allowing the model to dynamically weight the contribution of each modality based on the input. Given embeddings $\{\mathbf{z}_i^{(1)}, \mathbf{z}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{z}_i^{(M)}\}$, we compute attention weights $\alpha_i^{(m)}$ that indicate the importance of modality $m$ for predicting the outcome of patient $i$:

$$
\alpha_i^{(m)} = \frac{\exp(w^{(m)\top} \mathbf{z}_i^{(m)})}{\sum_{m'=1}^{M} \exp(w^{(m')\top} \mathbf{z}_i^{(m')})}
$$

The fused representation is then a weighted combination:

$$
\mathbf{h}_i = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \alpha_i^{(m)} \mathbf{z}_i^{(m)}
$$

More sophisticated attention mechanisms compute attention weights based on interactions between modalities. Cross-modal attention allows one modality to attend to another:

$$
\mathbf{q}_i = W_q \mathbf{z}_i^{(1)}, \quad \mathbf{k}_i^{(m)} = W_k \mathbf{z}_i^{(m)}, \quad \mathbf{v}_i^{(m)} = W_v \mathbf{z}_i^{(m)}
$$

$$
\alpha_i^{(m)} = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{q}_i^\top \mathbf{k}_i^{(m)} / \sqrt{d})}{\sum_{m'=2}^{M} \exp(\mathbf{q}_i^\top \mathbf{k}_i^{(m')} / \sqrt{d})}
$$

$$
\mathbf{h}_i = \mathbf{z}_i^{(1)} + \sum_{m=2}^{M} \alpha_i^{(m)} \mathbf{v}_i^{(m)}
$$

This formulation, inspired by transformer architectures, allows imaging data (modality 1) to query information from clinical notes (modalities 2 through $M $), creating rich cross-modal representations. The attention weights $\alpha_i^{(m)}$ also provide interpretability, indicating which modalities were most informative for each prediction.

### Co-Attention and Transformer-Based Fusion

Co-attention mechanisms extend cross-modal attention by allowing bidirectional information flow between modalities. For two modalities with embeddings $\mathbf{z}_i^{(1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$ and $\mathbf{z}_i^{(2)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$, co-attention computes:

$$
\mathbf{C}_i = \tanh(\mathbf{z}_i^{(1)} W_c (\mathbf{z}_i^{(2)})^\top)
$$

where $\mathbf{C}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_2}$ captures pairwise affinities between elements of the two modalities. Attention weights are derived from $\mathbf{C}_i$ to produce modality-specific attended representations that encode information from both modalities.

Transformer architectures have been adapted for multimodal learning by treating embeddings from different modalities as different types of tokens in a sequence. Given modality embeddings, we add modality-specific positional encodings:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i^{(m)} = \mathbf{z}_i^{(m)} + \mathbf{e}^{(m)}
$$

where $\mathbf{e}^{(m)}$ is a learned modality embedding. These tokens are then processed by transformer layers:

$$
\mathbf{Z}_i^{(l+1)} = \text{TransformerLayer}(\mathbf{Z}_i^{(l)})
$$

where $\mathbf{Z}_i^{(l)} = [\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i^{(1)}, \tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i^{(M)}]$ at layer $l$. The transformer's self-attention mechanism allows each modality to attend to all others, learning rich cross-modal interactions. The final prediction is typically derived from a special classification token or by pooling across all modality tokens.

### Joint Embedding Spaces and Contrastive Learning

An alternative approach to multimodal learning focuses on learning a joint embedding space where semantically similar inputs from different modalities are mapped to nearby points. This is particularly valuable when we have paired multimodal data but limited labeled outcomes. For instance, we might have many chest X-rays with associated radiology reports but few with disease labels.

Contrastive learning trains encoders to maximize agreement between different views of the same entity while minimizing agreement between different entities. For modalities $ m $ and $ m'$ with paired data $(\mathbf{x}_i^{(m)}, \mathbf{x}_i^{(m')})$, we compute embeddings and maximize their similarity while minimizing similarity to negative pairs:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrast}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)}, \mathbf{z}_i^{(m')}) / \tau)}{\sum_{j \neq i} \exp(\text{sim}(\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)}, \mathbf{z}_j^{(m')}) / \tau)}
$$

where $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a similarity function (typically cosine similarity), and $\tau $ is a temperature parameter. This loss, known as InfoNCE, encourages the encoders to produce aligned representations across modalities. In clinical settings, this allows learning from image-text pairs (such as radiographs and reports) without explicit labels, then fine-tuning on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks.

The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework has demonstrated remarkable success in learning joint vision-language representations. Adaptations for clinical data, such as BiomedCLIP and RadFM, learn alignments between medical images and clinical text, enabling zero-shot or few-shot prediction on new tasks by computing similarity between image embeddings and text descriptions of diseases.

## Architectures for Clinical Multimodal Learning

### Vision-Language Models for Medical Imaging

Medical imaging reports naturally pair images with text, making vision-language models particularly applicable. The standard architecture consists of an image encoder (typically a convolutional neural network or vision transformer), a text encoder (typically a transformer-based language model), and a mechanism to align their representations.

For a chest radiograph $\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}}$ and associated report $\mathbf{x}_{\text{text}}$, we compute:

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{img}} = \phi_{\text{img}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}}), \quad \mathbf{z}_{\text{text}} = \phi_{\text{text}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{text}})
$$

These embeddings are projected to a joint space:

$$
\mathbf{u}_{\text{img}} = W_{\text{img}} \mathbf{z}_{\text{img}}, \quad \mathbf{u}_{\text{text}} = W_{\text{text}} \mathbf{z}_{\text{text}}
$$

The contrastive loss aligns paired image-text embeddings. Once trained, the model can be used for various downstream tasks. For classification, we compute similarity between the image embedding and text embeddings of disease descriptions. For report generation, the image embedding serves as context for an autoregressive text decoder.

Clinical vision-language models face unique challenges compared to natural images. Medical images often contain subtle pathological findings requiring high-resolution processing. Reports contain domain-specific terminology and follow semi-structured templates. Moreover, reports may be incomplete or focus on normal findings, providing weak supervision.

### Multimodal Fusion for Structured EHR Data

Electronic health records integrate diverse structured data: demographics, vital signs, laboratory values, medications, and procedures. While these are all "structured," they have different statistical properties. Laboratory values are continuous but often missing, medications are categorical with complex interactions, and procedures occur at irregular time points.

A typical multimodal EHR architecture processes each data type separately before fusion. Continuous variables pass through feedforward networks with normalization:

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{lab}} = \phi_{\text{lab}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{lab}})
$$

Categorical variables are embedded:

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{med}} = \sum_{j} \mathbf{E}_{\text{med}}[x_{\text{med},j}]
$$

where $\mathbf{E}_{\text{med}}$ is a learned embedding matrix. Time-series data (vital signs, treatments over time) are processed by recurrent networks or transformers:

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{ts}} = \text{RNN}(\{\mathbf{x}_{\text{ts}}^{(t_1)}, \mathbf{x}_{\text{ts}}^{(t_2)}, \ldots\})
$$

These embeddings are fused using attention or concatenation:

$$
\mathbf{h} = \text{FusionModule}([\mathbf{z}_{\text{lab}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{med}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{ts}}])
$$

The fusion module might be a feedforward network, attention mechanism, or graph neural network that models relationships between data types.

### Integrating Imaging, Text, and Structured Data

The most challenging multimodal scenarios combine fundamentally different data types: images, unstructured text, and structured data. Consider predicting acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients using chest radiographs, clinical notes, and laboratory values. Each modality provides complementary information: imaging reveals pulmonary edema (a complication of fluid overload), notes document urine output and medication exposure, and laboratory values quantify renal function.

A comprehensive architecture processes each modality with appropriate encoders:

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{img}} = \phi_{\text{img}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}}; \theta_{\text{img}})
$$

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{text}} = \phi_{\text{text}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{text}}; \theta_{\text{text}})
$$

$$
\mathbf{z}_{\text{lab}} = \phi_{\text{lab}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{lab}}; \theta_{\text{lab}})
$$

A cross-modal transformer fuses these embeddings:

$$
\mathbf{Z} = [\mathbf{z}_{\text{img}} + \mathbf{e}_{\text{img}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{text}} + \mathbf{e}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{lab}} + \mathbf{e}_{\text{lab}}]
$$

$$
\mathbf{H} = \text{Transformer}(\mathbf{Z}; \theta_{\text{trans}})
$$

$$
\hat{y} = \text{softmax}(W_{\text{out}} \text{Pool}(\mathbf{H}) + b_{\text{out}})
$$

The modality embeddings $\mathbf{e}_{\text{img}}, \mathbf{e}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{e}_{\text{lab}}$ inform the transformer which modality each token represents. The pooling operation aggregates information across modalities, typically using the first token's output (if a CLS token is prepended) or average pooling.

## Handling Missing Modalities in Clinical Settings

Missing modalities are pervasive in clinical settings. Not all patients receive imaging studies; laboratory tests are ordered based on clinical indication; advanced diagnostics may be unavailable in resource-constrained settings. A multimodal model that requires all modalities during inference is impractical for clinical deployment. Moreover, missingness is often not random: certain modalities are systematically absent in particular populations or care settings, creating potential for bias.

### Architectural Strategies for Missing Modalities

**Modality Dropout During Training:** A simple but effective approach introduces modality dropout during training. With probability $ p_{\text{drop}}^{(m)}$, we set the embedding for modality $ m $ to a learned mask token or zero vector:

$\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_i^{(m)} = \begin{cases}
\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)} & \text{with probability } 1 - p_{\text{drop}}^{(m)} \\
\mathbf{z}_{\text{mask}}^{(m)} & \text{with probability } p_{\text{drop}}^{(m)}
\end{cases}$

This forces the model to learn representations that remain informative even when certain modalities are absent. The dropout probabilities should reflect the expected missingness patterns at deployment: if imaging is available for only fifty percent of patients, set $ p_{\text{drop}}^{(\text{img})} = 0.5$.

**Modality-Specific Adapters:** Another approach trains a universal multimodal model with modality-specific adapter networks that activate only when the modality is present:

$$
\mathbf{h}_i = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbb{1}[m \in \mathcal{M}_i] \cdot \text{Adapter}^{(m)}(\mathbf{z}_i^{(m)})
$$

where $\mathcal{M}_i$ is the set of available modalities for patient $i$, and $\mathbb{1}[\cdot]$ is an indicator function. Each adapter is a small feedforward network that transforms modality-specific embeddings to a common space. This architecture naturally handles any combination of available modalities without requiring retraining.

**Mixture of Modality Experts:** We can train separate expert models for each modality subset, then route each patient to the appropriate expert based on available modalities. For $ M $ modalities, this requires training $ 2^M - 1$ models (one for each non-empty subset). While computationally expensive during training, this approach allows each expert to optimize for its specific input pattern. A gating network can dynamically weight expert predictions when multiple experts are applicable:

$$
\hat{y}_i = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}_i} \alpha_{i,s} \cdot \hat{y}_{i,s}
$$

where $\mathcal{S}_i$ is the set of experts compatible with patient $i$'s available modalities, and $\alpha_{i,s}$ are learned gating weights.

### Generative Approaches for Missing Modalities

Rather than handling missing modalities during prediction, we can attempt to impute the missing data. Generative models learn the conditional distribution of one modality given others, allowing synthesis of missing modalities.

For instance, given a patient's clinical notes and laboratory values, we might generate a plausible chest radiograph:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{img}} \sim p(\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{x}_{\text{lab}}; \theta_{\text{gen}})
$$

This generated image can then be used by the multimodal model. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion models have all been explored for cross-modal generation in medical imaging.

However, this approach requires caution in clinical settings. Generated images may contain hallucinated findings that mislead downstream predictions. If the generative model introduces systematic artifacts, these can propagate to the multimodal classifier. Moreover, generating missing modalities may obscure the fact that data was unavailable, which itself may be clinically informative.

A more conservative approach uses generative models to estimate uncertainty about the missing modality. Rather than generating a single imputation, we sample multiple plausible imputations and propagate this uncertainty through the prediction:

$$
\hat{y}_i = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}} \sim p(\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{x}_{\text{lab}})}[f(\mathbf{x}_{\text{img}}, \mathbf{x}_{\text{text}}, \mathbf{x}_{\text{lab}})]
$$

This Monte Carlo estimate provides both a point prediction and uncertainty bounds reflecting the missing information.

### Fairness Implications of Missing Modalities

Missingness patterns often correlate with demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status. Patients in rural areas may have limited access to advanced imaging. Safety-net hospitals may lack the resources for comprehensive laboratory panels. Certain populations may face barriers to completing diagnostic workups due to cost, transportation, or language barriers.

If a multimodal model's performance degrades significantly when certain modalities are missing, and those modalities are systematically absent in underserved populations, the model will exhibit disparate performance. We must therefore evaluate models across all relevant missingness patterns and demographic groups.

Define a missingness pattern $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, M\}$ as a subset of available modalities. For each pattern $\mathcal{M}$ and demographic group $g$, we compute performance metrics:

$$
\text{Performance}(\mathcal{M}, g) = \text{Metric}(\hat{\mathbf{y}}[\mathcal{M}_i = \mathcal{M}, G_i = g], \mathbf{y}[\mathcal{M}_i = \mathcal{M}, G_i = g])
$$

where $[\cdot]$ denotes subsetting. A model is fair across missingness patterns if performance is similar across groups for each missingness pattern:

$$
\lvert \text{Performance}(\mathcal{M}, g) - \text{Performance}(\mathcal{M}, g') \rvert < \epsilon \quad \forall \mathcal{M}, g, g'
$$

This criterion is stronger than typical fairness metrics because it requires equitable performance not only across groups but also across patterns of data availability.

## Interpretability for Multimodal Models

Understanding how multimodal models make predictions is essential for clinical adoption. Clinicians need to know which modalities and features drove a prediction, both to verify clinical plausibility and to identify potential errors or biases.

### Attention Visualization

When using attention-based fusion, the attention weights $\alpha^{(m)}$ indicate the relative importance of each modality for a given prediction. Visualizing these weights provides a high-level summary of the model's reasoning:

$$
\text{Importance}^{(m)} = \frac{\alpha^{(m)}}{\sum_{m'} \alpha^{(m')}}
$$

For a patient with chest radiograph, clinical notes, and laboratory values, we might find that the model assigns seventy percent weight to imaging, twenty percent to notes, and ten percent to labs, suggesting that imaging findings were the primary driver of the prediction.

However, attention weights alone do not provide complete interpretability. High attention on a modality does not necessarily mean that modality caused the prediction; attention reflects what the model attends to, not necessarily what it uses. Moreover, attention operates on learned embeddings whose meaning may not align with clinical concepts.

### Cross-Modal Gradients

Gradient-based methods can identify which features within each modality contribute most to predictions. For a multimodal model $f(\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^{(M)})$, the gradient of the output with respect to inputs in modality $ m$ indicates feature importance:

$$
\mathbf{g}^{(m)} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x}^{(m)}}
$$

For imaging modalities, these gradients can be visualized as saliency maps highlighting image regions that influenced the prediction. For text, gradients indicate which words or phrases were most important. For structured data, gradients quantify the sensitivity of predictions to each feature.

Cross-modal gradients can also reveal interactions between modalities. The mixed partial derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \mathbf{x}^{(m)} \partial \mathbf{x}^{(m')}}
$$

captures how changing a feature in one modality affects the importance of features in another modality, revealing cross-modal synergies.

### Integrated Gradients for Multimodal Attribution

Integrated gradients provide a principled attribution method that satisfies desirable properties including sensitivity (if changing a feature changes the prediction, the feature receives non-zero attribution) and implementation invariance (attribution depends only on the function implemented by the model, not its architecture).

For each modality, we compute integrated gradients by accumulating gradients along a path from a baseline input to the actual input:

$$
\text{IG}^{(m)}(\mathbf{x}^{(m)}) = (\mathbf{x}^{(m)} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}^{(m)}) \times \int_{\alpha=0}^{1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x}^{(m)}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}^{(m)} + \alpha (\mathbf{x}^{(m)} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}^{(m)})) d\alpha
$$

The choice of baseline is important and modality-specific. For images, we might use a black image or Gaussian noise. For text, we might replace words with mask tokens. For structured data, we might use population means or zeros.

In practice, the integral is approximated by a finite sum over steps:

$$
\text{IG}^{(m)}(\mathbf{x}^{(m)}) \approx (\mathbf{x}^{(m)} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}^{(m)}) \times \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x}^{(m)}}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}^{(m)} + \frac{k}{n} (\mathbf{x}^{(m)} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{baseline}}^{(m)}))
$$

This provides feature-level attributions within each modality while naturally handling multimodal inputs.

### Modality Ablation Studies

A complementary approach to interpretability systematically removes or masks each modality and measures the change in predictions. For patient $i $ with prediction $\hat{y}_i$ using all modalities, we compute predictions using all subsets:

$$
\hat{y}_i^{(-m)} = f(\mathbf{x}_i^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_i^{(m-1)}, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{x}_i^{(m+1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_i^{(M)})
$$

The importance of modality $m$ is quantified by the change in prediction:

$$
\Delta_i^{(m)} = \lvert \hat{y}_i - \hat{y}_i^{(-m)} \rvert
$$

This can be extended to measure the importance of modality combinations by ablating multiple modalities simultaneously. Shapley values provide a principled framework for computing feature importance that satisfies desirable axioms (efficiency, symmetry, dummy, additivity). For modality $m$:

$$
\phi^{(m)} = \sum_{\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{M} \setminus \{m\}} \frac{\lvert \mathcal{S} \rvert! (M - \lvert \mathcal{S} \rvert - 1)!}{M!} [f(\mathcal{S} \cup \{m\}) - f(\mathcal{S})]
$$

where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of all modalities, and $ f(\mathcal{S})$ is the model's prediction using only modalities in set $\mathcal{S}$. Computing exact Shapley values requires evaluating $ 2^M$ subsets, but efficient approximations exist.

### Concept-Based Explanations

High-level clinical concepts may not align with individual features within modalities. Concept-based interpretability methods learn or define clinically meaningful concepts, then assess how much each concept contributed to a prediction.

For a predefined set of clinical concepts $\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_K\}$ (such as "pulmonary edema," "elevated creatinine," "history of heart failure"), we train concept detectors that identify the presence of each concept from multimodal inputs:

$$
p(c_k \mid \mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^{(M)}) = g_k(\phi^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}^{(1)}), \ldots, \phi^{(M)}(\mathbf{x}^{(M)}))
$$

We then train a final model that predicts the outcome from detected concepts:

$$
\hat{y} = h(p(c_1), \ldots, p(c_K))
$$

This two-stage approach provides interpretable explanations in terms of clinical concepts: "The model predicts high risk of acute kidney injury because it detected pulmonary edema in the chest X-ray (concept score 0.9) and elevated creatinine in the labs (concept score 0.85)."

Concepts can be defined by domain experts or discovered automatically through concept bottleneck models that jointly learn concepts and predictions while encouraging concepts to be human-interpretable.

## Implementation: Production-Ready Multimodal Clinical AI

We now develop comprehensive implementations of multimodal clinical AI systems, emphasizing robustness, fairness evaluation, and handling of missing modalities.

Healthcare facilities vary enormously in available diagnostic modalities. A tertiary academic medical center may have advanced imaging, comprehensive laboratory capabilities, and genomic sequencing. A rural community health center may have basic labs and limited imaging. Mobile health clinics serving homeless populations may rely primarily on point-of-care tests and clinical examination.

If a multimodal model requires chest radiographs, comprehensive metabolic panels, and clinical notes to function, it cannot be deployed in settings where these are unavailable. This creates a fundamental equity problem: the most sophisticated AI tools become available only in the most resourced settings, exacerbating rather than reducing disparities.

Design principles for equitable multimodal systems include graceful degradation, where performance declines gradually rather than catastrophically as modalities become unavailable, uncertainty quantification that increases as fewer modalities are available but never prevents deployment, and transparent reporting of which modality combinations were used for each prediction. A model should clearly indicate "This prediction used imaging and labs" versus "This prediction used only labs due to unavailable imaging," allowing clinicians to appropriately calibrate their trust.

### Computational Considerations

Multimodal models are computationally expensive. Processing high-resolution medical images through convolutional neural networks requires substantial GPU resources. Large language models for clinical text consume significant memory. In resource-constrained settings, these computational demands may be prohibitive.

Strategies for efficient deployment include model compression through quantization and pruning, knowledge distillation where a smaller student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher model, selective modality processing where computationally expensive modalities are only processed when clinically indicated, and edge deployment where models run locally rather than requiring cloud connectivity. The last point is particularly important for settings with unreliable internet connectivity.

### Regulatory Pathways

Multimodal clinical AI systems face complex regulatory challenges. In the United States, the FDA's framework for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) requires demonstrating safety and effectiveness for intended use. For multimodal systems, this raises questions about whether each modality combination requires separate validation. If a model is validated using imaging plus labs, can it be deployed using only labs without additional validation?

Current regulatory frameworks are evolving to address these questions. The FDA's proposed approach for adaptive AI systems provides some guidance, but multimodal systems introduce unique complexities. International regulatory harmonization through frameworks like the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) may help, but significant uncertainty remains.

### Ethical Frameworks for Multimodal AI

Beyond technical performance and regulatory compliance, multimodal clinical AI raises ethical questions. When a model makes different predictions based on which modalities are available, how should clinicians and patients interpret this uncertainty? If certain populations systematically lack access to particular modalities, does deploying a multimodal system that performs better when all modalities are available constitute discrimination?

The principle of justice in medical ethics requires equitable access to beneficial interventions. If multimodal AI genuinely improves care, equity demands ensuring access across populations. This may require deliberately designing systems that work well with minimal modality requirements, even if maximal performance requires more data. It may also require policy interventions to expand access to diagnostic modalities rather than accepting current inequities as immutable.

Transparency obligations require clearly communicating to patients and clinicians which data informed each prediction. Patients have a right to know whether their care decision was based on comprehensive multimodal analysis or limited data. This transparency enables informed consent and appropriate calibration of trust.

## Future Directions and Open Challenges

Multimodal learning for clinical AI remains an active research area with many open questions. Several directions warrant particular attention given equity considerations.

### Foundation Models for Medical Multimodal Learning

Large-scale foundation models pretrained on diverse multimodal medical data may enable few-shot or zero-shot adaptation to new clinical tasks. Models like GPT-4 with vision and Med-PaLM demonstrate this potential. However, ensuring these foundation models are trained on diverse, representative data is critical. If pretraining data comes primarily from academic medical centers in high-income countries, the resulting models may not generalize to underserved populations.

### Multimodal Bias Detection and Mitigation

Current fairness metrics typically evaluate overall model performance across demographic groups. For multimodal systems, we need methods to identify which modalities contribute to bias. If a model exhibits disparate performance across groups, is this driven by biased imaging, biased text, or biased integration? Causal inference methods may help disentangle these sources of bias, enabling targeted mitigation.

### Learning with Systematically Missing Data

Standard missing data methods assume data is missing at random or missing at random conditional on observed variables (MAR). In clinical settings, missingness is often not random: certain tests are not ordered for certain populations due to structural barriers, implicit bias, or resource constraints. Learning methods that account for such systematic missingness are needed.

### Multimodal Explanation Methods

While attention mechanisms provide some interpretability, understanding multimodal predictions remains challenging. How do we explain to a clinician that a model predicted high risk because of the combination of a specific imaging finding and a particular phrase in the clinical note? Concept-based explanations may help, but developing methods that align with clinical reasoning remains an open challenge.

### Evaluation Beyond Discrimination Metrics

Standard fairness metrics focus on discrimination: ensuring similar performance across groups. However, multimodal systems raise additional equity concerns about representation (are all groups adequately represented in training data), autonomy (do patients understand and consent to multimodal AI), and social determinants (does the model account for social factors that influence both data availability and outcomes). Comprehensive evaluation frameworks that address these dimensions are needed.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter developed the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of multimodal learning for clinical AI, with particular emphasis on the challenges of missing modalities and fairness across populations with differential data availability. We covered core fusion strategies from early concatenation through sophisticated attention mechanisms, implemented production-ready multimodal architectures with comprehensive handling of missing data, and established evaluation frameworks that assess fairness not only across demographic groups but also across patterns of data availability. The equity focus throughout recognized that data availability itself is a source of systematic bias, requiring models that degrade gracefully when certain modalities are unavailable rather than failing entirely. Clinical deployment requires recognizing that the most sophisticated multimodal systems risk being accessible only in the most resourced settings, potentially exacerbating rather than reducing health disparities. Future work must ensure that multimodal AI genuinely expands access to high-quality care rather than creating new barriers based on differential availability of advanced diagnostics.
