# Chapter 2: Mathematical Foundations with Health Equity Applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

1. Apply linear algebra concepts including vector spaces, matrix operations, eigendecompositions, and singular value decomposition to healthcare data problems, with specific understanding of how these mathematical structures can either reinforce or challenge existing health disparities.

2. Develop probabilistic reasoning for clinical decision-making under uncertainty, including proper application of Bayes' theorem when prior probabilities reflect historical discrimination rather than biological differences, and understanding of conditional independence assumptions that may fail in the presence of unmeasured confounders like structural racism.

3. Implement bias-aware statistical inference methods that account for systematic differences in data collection quality across populations, including approaches for handling missing data mechanisms that correlate with social determinants of health.

4. Design and validate mathematical models that explicitly quantify uncertainty in ways that differ across patient subgroups, recognizing when standard assumptions about error distributions or independence break down in real healthcare settings serving diverse populations.

5. Critically evaluate mathematical formulations of fairness and equity in machine learning, understanding the tradeoffs between different fairness definitions and their appropriateness for specific healthcare applications affecting underserved communities.

## 2.1 Introduction: Why Mathematics Matters for Health Equity

Mathematics provides the formal language through which we express relationships in data, quantify uncertainty, and optimize decisions. In healthcare artificial intelligence, mathematical choices shape everything from how we represent patient similarity to how we define what it means for an algorithm to be fair. These choices are never merely technical but rather encode assumptions about the world that have profound implications for health equity.

Consider the seemingly simple task of measuring similarity between patients to identify those who might benefit from similar treatments. The mathematical framework we choose for this measurement determines which patient characteristics we treat as comparable and which we treat as fundamentally different. If we represent patients as points in a high-dimensional space and use Euclidean distance to measure similarity, we implicitly assume that all features contribute equally to meaningful clinical similarity and that the relationships between features are linear. These assumptions may work reasonably well for some patient populations but fail catastrophically for others.

A concrete example illustrates the stakes. Suppose we are developing a system to identify patients similar to a given individual for the purpose of predicting treatment response based on outcomes in similar patients. We represent each patient as a vector containing age, body mass index, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and several other clinical measurements. For a middle-aged patient with well-controlled diabetes and good healthcare access, this representation may work well because their clinical trajectory is largely determined by the measured biomedical variables. But for a patient facing housing instability, food insecurity, and transportation barriers to care, the measured clinical variables capture only a small part of what determines their health trajectory. The unmeasured social factors may be far more important than the measured clinical ones, yet our mathematical similarity metric knows nothing about them.

The result is that our patient similarity algorithm will suggest treatment strategies based on patients whose clinical measurements are similar but whose actual circumstances are profoundly different. The recommendations may be inappropriate or even harmful, not because the mathematics was wrong in some abstract sense but because the mathematical framework was built on assumptions that don't hold for patients whose lives are shaped by social and structural factors that standard clinical data fails to capture.

This chapter develops mathematical foundations with sustained attention to how mathematical choices interact with health equity considerations. We begin with linear algebra because matrix operations pervade healthcare data analysis, from basic data transformations to sophisticated dimensionality reduction methods. But rather than presenting linear algebra in isolation, we ground every concept in healthcare applications and examine how the mathematical structures can either reveal or obscure health disparities. We then develop probability theory as the foundation for reasoning under uncertainty, but we do so while acknowledging that probability distributions in healthcare data often reflect social processes rather than natural phenomena, and that standard probabilistic assumptions frequently fail in ways that systematically disadvantage certain populations.

Throughout, we implement production-ready code that demonstrates not just how to perform mathematical operations but how to do so while maintaining critical awareness of their limitations and biases. The implementations include extensive validation and sensitivity analyses that surface when mathematical assumptions break down, with particular attention to whether these failures affect different patient populations differently. By the end of this chapter, you will have both the mathematical sophistication needed for advanced healthcare AI work and the critical lens needed to ensure that mathematical elegance doesn't come at the cost of health equity.

## 2.2 Linear Algebra for Healthcare Data

Linear algebra provides the mathematical framework for representing and manipulating healthcare data in ways that enable both human interpretation and algorithmic processing. Vectors represent individual patients or clinical measurements, matrices organize collections of observations or relationships between variables, and linear transformations enable us to change perspectives on data or reduce dimensionality while preserving important structure. Understanding linear algebra deeply means understanding not just the mechanics of matrix operations but also what these operations mean in healthcare contexts and how they can introduce or reveal bias.

### 2.2.1 Vector Spaces and Patient Representation

At the most fundamental level, we represent each patient as a point in a high-dimensional space where each dimension corresponds to a measured or derived feature. This vector representation enables us to apply geometric intuitions about distance, angles, and projections to reason about patient similarity, cluster structure, and predictive relationships. However, the choice of how to construct these vector representations involves numerous decisions that affect whether the resulting mathematical structure serves or undermines health equity goals.

Consider a patient represented by clinical measurements including age, systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, body mass index, and hemoglobin A1c. We can write this patient as a vector in five-dimensional space. However, the raw measurements have different units and scales: age in years, blood pressure in millimeters of mercury, creatinine in milligrams per deciliter, and so on. Computing distances between patients using raw measurements would mean that variables with larger numerical ranges would dominate the distance calculation, even if they are not more clinically important.

The standard mathematical solution is to standardize the features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, transforming each variable to have mean zero and unit variance. This standardization ensures that all features contribute comparably to distance calculations. But this seemingly neutral mathematical operation embeds important assumptions. When we standardize using the overall population mean and standard deviation, we implicitly assume that deviations from the population average are equally meaningful for all patients. Yet if different patient subgroups have systematically different distributions of these variables due to social determinants of health or differential access to care, standardizing to the overall population statistics may obscure rather than reveal clinically meaningful patterns.

Let me make this concrete with an implementation that demonstrates both standard vector operations and equity-aware alternatives:

This implementation demonstrates several equity-focused approaches to vector representation. The group-specific scaling option allows us to standardize features separately within each demographic group, which preserves within-group variation patterns that might be clinically meaningful even though they differ across groups. The quality-weighted distance calculation accounts for the fact that distances involving patients with poor data quality may be less reliable. And the bias analysis functionality explicitly checks whether the vector space representation creates systematic differences in how clustered or dispersed different demographic groups appear, which could indicate that the feature representation doesn't work equally well for all populations.

### 2.2.2 Matrix Operations and Data Transformations

Matrices organize collections of patient vectors and enable batch operations that transform entire datasets. Understanding matrix operations means understanding how data transformations affect the structure of information and how these transformations can introduce or reveal bias. We focus on operations that commonly arise in healthcare data analysis including matrix multiplication for feature transformations, matrix inverses for solving linear systems, and matrix decompositions that reveal latent structure.

Matrix multiplication is perhaps the most fundamental operation, enabling us to transform data from one representation to another through linear combinations of features. When we multiply a data matrix by a transformation matrix, we are computing new features as weighted combinations of the original features. This operation is at the heart of dimensionality reduction methods, linear models, and neural network layers. However, the choice of transformation matrix embeds assumptions about which combinations of features are meaningful, and these assumptions may not hold equally well across diverse patient populations.

Consider a simple example where we want to create a composite measure of cardiovascular risk from multiple individual risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status, and diabetes. We can express this as matrix multiplication where each patient is a row in our data matrix and each risk factor is a column, and we multiply by a weight vector that defines how much each factor contributes to the composite score. The standard approach is to set weights based on epidemiological studies that estimated the association between each risk factor and cardiovascular events. But if those studies were conducted primarily in populations different from the ones we are now trying to serve, the weights may be inappropriate and could systematically misestimate risk for certain groups.

Let me implement matrix operations with explicit attention to these equity considerations:

This implementation provides matrix operations with built-in equity checking. The linear combination validation checks whether the transformation relates to input features differently across demographic groups, which could indicate that the chosen weights aren't appropriate for all populations. The group-specific centering option preserves within-group correlation structure that global centering would erase. And the covariance analysis explicitly tests whether the covariance structure is homogeneous across groups, surfacing violations of this common modeling assumption.

### 2.2.3 Eigendecomposition and Principal Component Analysis

Eigendecomposition reveals the intrinsic structure of matrices by finding directions of maximal variation and the scaling factors along those directions. In healthcare data analysis, eigendecomposition underlies principal components analysis, which finds low-dimensional representations that capture most of the variation in high-dimensional data. However, PCA and related methods can introduce subtle biases when different patient populations have different correlation structures, as the principal components may primarily capture variation patterns from the dominant population while poorly representing patterns specific to minority populations.

The mathematical foundation is elegant. Given a covariance matrix Î£, eigendecomposition finds vectors v and scalars Î» such that Î£v = Î»v. The eigenvector v defines a direction in feature space, and the eigenvalue Î» quantifies the amount of variance along that direction. The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the direction of maximum variance, the second largest to the direction of maximum variance orthogonal to the first, and so on. Principal components analysis uses these eigenvectors as a new coordinate system in which to represent the data, with the hope that the first few principal components capture most of the meaningful variation.

The health equity concern arises when we apply PCA to data from heterogeneous populations. The principal components that best represent the dominant population may not best represent minority populations, especially if the minority populations have different correlation structures. The result is that dimensionality reduction may work well for some patients while losing important information for others. This differential information loss can then propagate through downstream modeling, leading to algorithms that perform better for well-represented populations.

Let me implement PCA with explicit equity safeguards:

This equity-aware PCA implementation explicitly tracks reconstruction quality across demographic groups, which reveals when dimensionality reduction works better for some populations than others. The reconstruction error analysis provides an early warning that the principal components may not be appropriate for all populations, allowing us to either adjust the number of components retained or consider alternative dimensionality reduction approaches that better preserve information for minority populations.

### 2.2.4 Singular Value Decomposition and Matrix Factorization

Singular value decomposition provides an alternative perspective on matrix structure that generalizes eigendecomposition to non-square matrices and connects naturally to many machine learning methods including collaborative filtering, latent semantic analysis, and matrix completion. SVD factorizes a data matrix X into three matrices: X = UÎ£V^T, where U contains left singular vectors, Î£ is a diagonal matrix of singular values, and V contains right singular vectors. This decomposition reveals latent structure in data and enables low-rank approximations that can denoise data or reduce dimensionality.

In healthcare applications, SVD and related matrix factorization methods are used for tasks including identifying patient subgroups based on similar clinical patterns, discovering latent disease phenotypes from symptom and biomarker data, and imputing missing values in partially observed clinical matrices. However, these methods face equity challenges similar to those we saw with PCA. The latent factors discovered by matrix factorization may primarily reflect patterns in well-represented populations while missing important patterns specific to minority populations. Moreover, when using matrix factorization for missing data imputation, the imputed values will reflect the patterns learned from observed data, which may not be appropriate if missingness patterns differ systematically across groups.

Let me implement SVD-based methods with explicit equity considerations:

These SVD and matrix factorization implementations include equity safeguards at multiple levels. The SVD-based imputation tracks imputation quality across demographic groups to detect when imputed values have different statistical properties for different populations. The matrix factorization analysis checks whether discovered latent factors are concentrated in specific demographic groups, which could indicate that the factorization is primarily capturing patterns from those groups while missing important structure in other populations.

## 2.3 Probability Theory for Clinical Decision Making

Probability theory provides the mathematical framework for reasoning about uncertainty, which is fundamental to clinical decision making where diagnoses are uncertain, prognoses are probabilistic, and treatment effects vary across individuals. However, applying probability theory to healthcare data requires careful attention to where the probabilities come from and what they represent. Probability distributions in healthcare often reflect social and historical processes rather than natural phenomena, and standard probabilistic assumptions can fail in ways that systematically disadvantage certain populations.

### 2.3.1 Probability Distributions and Clinical Data

A probability distribution describes the relative likelihood of different outcomes or the relative frequency with which different values of a variable occur. In healthcare applications, we use probability distributions to model diagnostic test results, disease prevalence in populations, treatment response rates, survival times, and many other uncertain quantities. However, the interpretation of these distributions requires understanding not just the mathematics but also the data generation process.

Consider a seemingly straightforward example: the distribution of blood pressure measurements in a patient population. We might model systolic blood pressure as following a normal distribution with a mean of 120 mmHg and a standard deviation of 15 mmHg. But this statistical model obscures important realities. The observed distribution reflects not just biological variation but also who has access to blood pressure measurement, how measurement protocols vary across clinical settings, whether measurements are taken in stressful environments like emergency departments or in calmer primary care settings, and systematic differences in measurement accuracy across patient body sizes and skin tones. The "true" distribution of underlying physiological blood pressure may be quite different from the observed distribution of recorded measurements.

The equity implications become clearer when we recognize that these measurement and selection processes are not uniform across populations. Patients with regular primary care access will have blood pressure distributions that reflect stable ongoing management, while patients who only interface with healthcare during acute illness will have distributions skewed toward higher values. Patients seen primarily in community health centers may have different measurement protocols than those seen in tertiary care centers. If we build prediction models or decision rules based on probability distributions estimated from one population and apply them to another, we may make systematically biased predictions.

This probability modeling implementation explicitly checks whether distributions are homogeneous across demographic groups and warns when pooled estimates may be inappropriate. The conditional probability calculation provides stratified estimates that reveal when relationships differ across populations, which is essential for avoiding biased predictions that assume universality when relationships are actually heterogeneous.

### 2.3.2 Bayes' Theorem and Prior Probabilities in Healthcare

Bayes' theorem provides the mathematical foundation for updating beliefs based on evidence, formally stating that the posterior probability of a hypothesis given observed data is proportional to the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis times the prior probability of the hypothesis. In healthcare, Bayesian reasoning appears in diagnostic test interpretation, where we update our assessment of disease probability based on test results, and in clinical prediction models that combine prior information with patient-specific features.

The mathematical statement is elegant: P(disease | test+) = P(test+ | disease) Ã— P(disease) / P(test+), where P(disease | test+) is the posterior probability of disease given a positive test, P(test+ | disease) is the test sensitivity, P(disease) is the prior probability or prevalence, and P(test+) is the marginal probability of a positive test. However, applying this formula in practice requires careful attention to where the prior probabilities come from and whether they are appropriate for the specific patient.

The health equity challenge is that prior probabilities often reflect historical patterns of disease diagnosis that may be systematically biased. If a condition has been historically underdiagnosed in certain populations due to lack of access to care, implicit bias in clinical evaluation, or other systemic factors, then prevalence estimates derived from diagnostic databases will underestimate true disease burden in those populations. Using these biased priors in Bayesian reasoning will then lead to systematic underdiagnosis that perpetuates the original inequity.

Consider screening for diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The prior probability of retinopathy depends on how long diabetes has been present, how well controlled blood sugar has been, and other factors. But it also depends on how consistently the patient has had access to diabetic care and whether previous retinal examinations were performed and documented. For a patient with intermittent healthcare access whose diabetes may have been present but undiagnosed for years, the standard prior probability based on documented diabetes duration will systematically underestimate retinopathy risk. A Bayesian diagnostic approach using that prior will then underweight positive screening results, potentially leading to delayed treatment.

Let me implement Bayesian reasoning with explicit attention to prior probability issues:

This Bayesian reasoning implementation includes sensitivity analysis for prior probability uncertainty and explicit tools for adjusting priors when we suspect systematic bias in observed prevalence estimates. The comparison between Bayesian and frequentist approaches helps illustrate how prior information affects inference, which is particularly important when we have reason to question whether standard priors are appropriate for specific populations.

### 2.3.3 Conditional Independence and Graphical Models

Conditional independence is a critical concept that underlies much of probabilistic modeling in healthcare AI. Two variables X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if P(X, Y | Z) = P(X | Z) P(Y | Z), meaning that once we know Z, learning X provides no additional information about Y. This concept enables us to build tractable probabilistic models of complex systems by decomposing joint probability distributions into products of simpler conditional distributions.

However, conditional independence assumptions often fail in healthcare data in ways that reflect social and structural confounding rather than measurement error. Consider predicting hospital readmission using clinical variables like prior hospitalizations, chronic conditions, and functional status. Standard modeling approaches might assume that these clinical variables are conditionally independent given some latent health status. But in reality, many clinical variables are jointly influenced by social determinants like housing stability, food security, and access to primary care. Unmeasured confounders like structural racism affect multiple variables simultaneously, violating conditional independence assumptions in systematic ways.

The implications for model fairness are profound. When we build predictive models that assume conditional independence but the assumption fails due to unmeasured confounding that differs across populations, the resulting predictions will be systematically biased. The bias won't necessarily be detected by standard model validation because the conditional independence violations are embedded in the training data structure.

Let me implement tools for testing and working with conditional independence assumptions:

from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, pearsonr

This conditional independence framework provides tools for detecting when standard modeling assumptions break down, with particular attention to whether violations differ across demographic groups. When we detect confounding that varies by demographics, it suggests that models built on the pooled data may systematically misrepresent relationships for some populations.

## 2.4 Statistical Inference with Equity Considerations

Statistical inference provides methods for drawing conclusions about populations from samples, quantifying uncertainty in estimates, and testing hypotheses about relationships in data. However, standard inferential methods make assumptions about random sampling, independent observations, and homogeneous populations that frequently fail in healthcare data. When these assumptions fail differently for different patient populations, standard inference can lead to systematically biased conclusions.

### 2.4.1 Sampling Bias and Selection Effects

The foundation of statistical inference is the assumption that our sample is representative of the population we want to draw conclusions about. In healthcare research, this assumption is routinely violated because healthcare data is fundamentally observational rather than randomly sampled. Patients appear in datasets because they sought care, had insurance coverage, lived near a healthcare facility, and were documented in an electronic health record system. Each of these selection steps can introduce bias.

The equity implications are severe. Underserved populations face systematic barriers to healthcare access, meaning they are systematically underrepresented in healthcare datasets. When they do appear in datasets, it is often in crisis situations like emergency department visits rather than in longitudinal primary care where comprehensive data accrues. The result is that statistical estimates derived from healthcare data systematically misrepresent the health status and healthcare needs of underserved populations.

Consider estimating the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in a population using electronic health record data. The naive estimate would simply compute the proportion of patients with most recent blood pressure measurements above target values. But this estimate is biased because it only includes patients who had blood pressure measured, and blood pressure measurement rates differ systematically across populations based on access to care. Patients with good healthcare access get regular blood pressure monitoring and early treatment, while patients with limited access may only have blood pressure measured when acutely ill or in emergency settings. The observed prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension will therefore be higher in populations with limited access, not necessarily because true hypertension rates are higher but because we are selectively sampling individuals at times when their blood pressure is more likely to be elevated.

This inference framework explicitly accounts for selection bias and provides tools for stratified analysis that surface when overall estimates don't represent all populations well. The multiple comparison adjustments are essential when conducting numerous group comparisons to avoid false discoveries.

### 2.4.2 Bootstrapping and Resampling Methods

Bootstrap resampling provides a powerful approach to statistical inference that makes minimal distributional assumptions. By repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data and computing statistics on each bootstrap sample, we can empirically estimate the sampling distribution of any statistic and construct confidence intervals without assuming normality or other specific distributional forms. However, standard bootstrap methods can fail when data has complex structure or when we need to respect correlations and clustering in the data.

In healthcare applications serving diverse populations, we often want to ensure that bootstrap samples maintain appropriate representation of demographic groups and preserve within-group correlation structures. Standard bootstrapping that samples individuals independently may produce bootstrap samples with poor representation of minority populations by chance, leading to unstable estimates of group-specific parameters.

Let me implement equity-aware bootstrap methods:

```python
class EquityAwareBootstrap:
    """
    Bootstrap resampling methods that maintain appropriate representation
    of demographic groups and respect data structure.

These bootstrap methods maintain demographic representation and provide group-stratified inference that surfaces heterogeneity. The stratified bootstrap ensures that minority populations don't get under-represented by chance in bootstrap samples, which would lead to unstable estimates of their parameters.

## 2.5 Conclusion and Key Takeaways

This chapter has developed mathematical foundations for healthcare AI with sustained attention to how mathematical choices interact with health equity considerations. We've seen that mathematics in healthcare is never purely technical but rather embeds assumptions and value judgments that have differential impacts across patient populations. Linear algebra operations like standardization and dimensionality reduction can obscure or reveal health disparities depending on whether they preserve within-group variation structures. Probability distributions reflect not just biological variation but also social processes of healthcare access and measurement. Statistical inference methods make sampling assumptions that are routinely violated in healthcare data in ways that systematically disadvantage underserved populations.

The key insight is that achieving health equity through AI requires not just applying sophisticated mathematical methods but rather maintaining critical awareness of when mathematical assumptions break down and how these failures affect different populations differently. Every implementation in this chapter includes explicit checks for whether mathematical assumptions hold uniformly across demographic groups, sensitivity analyses that quantify uncertainty when assumptions are questionable, and stratified analyses that surface heterogeneity that pooled analyses would obscure.

The chapters that follow build on these mathematical foundations to develop machine learning and deep learning methods for healthcare applications. Throughout, we maintain the principle established here: mathematical sophistication must be paired with critical awareness of social context. The most elegant mathematical formulation is worthless if it produces biased predictions that widen rather than narrow health disparities. Success in healthcare AI requires both technical excellence and sustained commitment to equity.
