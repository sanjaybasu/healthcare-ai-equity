# Chapter 17: Regulatory Considerations for Clinical AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

1. Navigate the complex regulatory landscape for clinical artificial intelligence systems, including FDA pathways for software as a medical device, ONC certification requirements for electronic health record integration, and state-level regulations affecting AI deployment in healthcare settings serving underserved populations.

2. Develop comprehensive regulatory documentation that explicitly addresses intended use populations, validation cohorts, known limitations and failure modes, and equity considerations required by regulatory bodies increasingly focused on algorithmic fairness in healthcare.

3. Implement HIPAA-compliant AI systems that properly handle protected health information while maintaining security, privacy, and audit capabilities, with particular attention to vulnerabilities that disproportionately affect underserved communities where data breaches can have especially severe consequences.

4. Design post-market surveillance systems that continuously monitor deployed AI for performance degradation, fairness violations, and safety issues, with stratification by demographic groups and care settings to detect disparate impacts that might be masked in aggregate metrics.

5. Prepare for regulatory submissions including clinical validation studies, risk analysis documentation, and quality management system records that demonstrate systematic attention to health equity throughout the development lifecycle.

6. Understand international regulatory frameworks including EU Medical Device Regulation, UK MHRA guidance, and emerging standards from WHO and ISO that increasingly incorporate fairness and equity considerations into medical AI oversight.

## 17.1 Introduction: Why Regulation Matters for Health Equity

Healthcare artificial intelligence operates in a heavily regulated environment for good reason. Medical devices that make incorrect predictions or provide inappropriate recommendations can directly harm patients through delayed diagnoses, unnecessary treatments, or missed opportunities for intervention. The stakes are particularly high when AI systems are deployed at scale, potentially affecting millions of patients. Regulation serves to protect patients by establishing minimum standards for safety, effectiveness, and quality, requiring manufacturers to demonstrate their products work as intended before marketing, and mandating ongoing monitoring to detect problems after deployment.

From a health equity perspective, regulation plays a crucial additional role. Without regulatory oversight explicitly focused on fairness, market forces alone are unlikely to produce equitable AI systems. Developers face stronger commercial incentives to optimize performance for well-represented majority populations than to ensure equitable performance across diverse groups. Testing and validation on representative populations is more expensive and time-consuming than validation on convenient samples. Post-market surveillance systems that stratify by demographics and care settings cost more to implement than simple aggregate monitoring. In the absence of regulatory requirements, these equity-critical activities become optional extras rather than essential components of responsible development.

Recent years have seen growing recognition among regulators that algorithmic fairness cannot be an afterthought but must be integrated throughout the development and deployment lifecycle. The FDA's 2021 action plan for AI and machine learning in medical devices explicitly acknowledges the importance of diverse training data and the need to evaluate performance across patient subgroups. The EU's proposed AI Act establishes specific requirements for high-risk AI systems including documentation of training data representativeness and ongoing monitoring of discriminatory impacts. The WHO has published guidance emphasizing that AI for health must be designed to reduce rather than perpetuate inequities.

Yet significant challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks developed for traditional medical devices don't always translate cleanly to adaptive AI systems that continue learning after deployment. The distinction between what counts as a medical device requiring pre-market approval versus clinical decision support exempt from such oversight remains unclear for many AI applications. International fragmentation means developers must navigate multiple regulatory regimes with potentially conflicting requirements. Most fundamentally, the science of measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias in healthcare is still evolving, making it difficult for regulators to establish specific technical standards.

This chapter provides practical guidance for navigating regulatory requirements for clinical AI with consistent focus on health equity implications. We cover major regulatory frameworks including FDA software as a medical device pathways, ONC certification for EHR integration, and HIPAA compliance for privacy. We examine documentation requirements and quality management systems that enable systematic attention to fairness. We implement concrete tools for regulatory documentation including bias assessment templates, intended use specification frameworks, and post-market surveillance systems with equity monitoring. Throughout, we emphasize that meeting regulatory requirements and advancing health equity are complementary rather than competing goals.

## 17.2 FDA Regulation of AI as Medical Devices

The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with authority established through the 1976 Medical Device Amendments and subsequent legislation. Software that meets the definition of a medical device falls under this regulatory framework regardless of whether it runs on dedicated hardware, in the cloud, or as a mobile application. Understanding when AI systems constitute medical devices and which regulatory pathway applies is essential for legal compliance and patient safety.

### 17.2.1 Defining Medical Devices and Clinical Decision Support

The FDA defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar article intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or intended to affect the structure or function of the body. Software qualifies as a medical device when it meets this definition. The critical factor is intended useâ€”what is the software designed to do and what claims does the manufacturer make about its capabilities.

Clinical decision support software occupies a particularly nuanced position in this framework. The 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 created explicit exemptions for certain clinical decision support functions. Software is exempt from device regulation if it meets specific criteria including providing recommendations to healthcare providers rather than making autonomous decisions, displaying the basis for recommendations such that the clinician can independently evaluate the underlying data, and clearly indicating that recommendations are for informational purposes and should be combined with clinical judgment. This exemption recognizes that not all software that supports clinical decisions rises to the level of risk requiring pre-market review.

However, the line between exempt clinical decision support and regulated medical devices is often unclear in practice, particularly for AI systems. Consider a machine learning model that analyzes chest radiographs to detect pneumonia. If the system presents findings to radiologists who make the final interpretation, is it clinical decision support or a diagnostic device? The answer depends on implementation details including how prominently AI findings are displayed, whether radiologists can easily review the original images without AI assistance, and how the system is marketed. The FDA has indicated that software driving clinical management without independent human review likely constitutes a device requiring regulation, while software that provides recommendations clinicians can verify using their own judgment may qualify for exemption.

From an equity perspective, the clinical decision support exemption creates both opportunities and risks. Exempt software can be deployed more quickly and updated more rapidly than regulated devices, potentially enabling faster iteration to address fairness issues discovered post-deployment. However, exemption also means no pre-market review of performance across patient subgroups, no requirement to collect diverse validation data, and no mandated post-market surveillance. Software affecting healthcare disparities may reach widespread deployment without ever demonstrating equitable performance if it qualifies for exemption. This tension has led some advocates to argue for requiring fairness evaluation even for exempt clinical decision support, while others worry that excessive regulation will stifle beneficial innovation.

### 17.2.2 Risk Classification and Regulatory Pathways

The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk and required level of regulatory control. Class I devices pose minimal risk and require only general controls including registration, listing, and good manufacturing practices. Class II devices pose moderate risk and require general controls plus special controls such as performance standards and post-market surveillance. Class III devices pose high risk and require pre-market approval through extensive clinical testing demonstrating safety and effectiveness. Most software as a medical device falls into Class II, though some high-risk applications like radiation therapy planning systems are Class III.

For Class II devices, the primary regulatory pathway is premarket notification through the 510(k) process. This requires demonstrating substantial equivalence to a legally marketed predicate device. The manufacturer must show the new device has the same intended use as the predicate and either has the same technological characteristics or different characteristics that don't raise new questions of safety and effectiveness. The 510(k) pathway is attractive because it requires less time and expense than full pre-market approval, typically taking three to six months rather than years. However, the focus on equivalence to existing devices can perpetuate problems with predicates. If predicate devices were developed without adequate attention to fairness and validated only on non-representative populations, demonstrating equivalence may mean replicating rather than correcting these equity issues.

The FDA's traditional approach to 510(k) review examines clinical validity, analytical validity, and clinical utility. Clinical validity asks whether the device accurately measures or predicts the clinical outcome it claims to address. Analytical validity asks whether the device reliably and consistently produces its intended output. Clinical utility asks whether using the device information leads to better patient outcomes than available alternatives. For AI systems, demonstrating these properties across diverse patient populations requires going beyond simple accuracy metrics on convenience samples. Yet the FDA has historically not required detailed demographic breakdowns in 510(k) submissions, allowing devices to be cleared based on aggregate performance that might mask substantial disparities.

Recent FDA guidance signals increasing attention to fairness. The 2021 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Software as a Medical Device Action Plan acknowledges that AI models trained on non-representative data may perform differently across patient subgroups. The plan commits to developing good machine learning practices including recommendations on data management, feature engineering, and performance evaluation across intended patient populations. The 2023 draft guidance on clinical decision support software emphasizes the importance of validation on populations representative of intended users. While these documents establish aspirational goals rather than binding requirements, they indicate regulatory expectations are evolving toward explicit fairness evaluation.

### 17.2.3 Total Product Lifecycle Approach for Adaptive AI

Traditional medical devices are largely static once marketed. A knee implant approved in 2020 has the same physical characteristics when implanted in 2025 as when first manufactured. Software medical devices, particularly those incorporating machine learning, differ fundamentally in their ability to adapt over time. An AI system might be retrained with new data, have its decision thresholds adjusted based on real-world performance, or update its models to incorporate improved algorithms. This adaptability creates challenges for regulatory frameworks premised on devices remaining unchanged after approval.

The FDA has proposed a total product lifecycle approach to address the unique properties of adaptive AI systems. Under this framework, manufacturers would submit a predetermined change control plan as part of initial regulatory review. This plan would specify which types of changes the manufacturer might make after deployment, the methodology for implementing changes safely, and the evidence that would support each modification. For example, a diabetic retinopathy screening system might propose a plan to periodically retrain its model with new images while maintaining performance thresholds, update its calibration based on observed outcomes in different populations, and refine its image quality assessment algorithms. If the FDA approves this predetermined change control plan, the manufacturer can implement planned modifications without new regulatory submissions for each change.

This total product lifecycle approach creates opportunities for addressing fairness issues discovered post-deployment. Rather than being locked into a static model that performs inequitably, manufacturers could propose change control plans specifically addressing performance disparities. A system found to have lower sensitivity for detecting disease in patients with darker skin tones could be retrained with additional data from these populations, with the change control plan specifying performance thresholds that must be maintained across skin tones. A model exhibiting calibration drift in safety-net hospitals could have site-specific recalibration included in its predetermined change control plan.

However, the total product lifecycle approach also poses risks if not implemented with equity in mind. Change control plans focused solely on maintaining aggregate performance might approve modifications that improve performance for majority populations while degrading performance for underrepresented groups, as long as overall metrics remain acceptable. Plans that specify demographic subgroups for monitoring might inadvertently create incentives to simply exclude populations where performance is poor rather than investing in equitable performance. Most fundamentally, predetermined change control plans require manufacturers to anticipate what fairness issues might arise, which may be difficult when deploying into diverse real-world settings not well represented in pre-market testing.

### 17.2.4 Production Implementation: Regulatory Documentation System

We now implement a comprehensive framework for generating regulatory documentation with explicit equity considerations built into every component. This system provides templates and tools for creating 510(k) submissions, predetermined change control plans, and clinical validation reports that meet FDA expectations while systematically addressing fairness.

        "- Performance by insurance status, sex, and geographic location showed similar equity\n\n"
        "All demographic subgroups met pre-specified minimum performance thresholds of "
        "sensitivity â‰¥0.85 and specificity â‰¥0.82. Statistical testing confirmed no "
        "demographic group performed significantly worse than others (p>0.05 for all "
        "pairwise comparisons after Bonferroni correction).\n\n"
        "CARE SETTING ANALYSIS\n\n"
        "Performance was evaluated across care setting types to ensure equitable function "
        "in resource-limited contexts. Settings included academic medical centers (gold "
        "standard), community health centers, FQHCs serving predominantly low-income "
        "populations, private practices, and rural clinics. Sensitivity ranged from 0.903 "
        "to 0.925 across settings, with academic medical centers showing highest performance "
        "likely due to better image quality from newer equipment and more trained imaging "
        "staff. Importantly, FQHCs and rural clinics maintained sensitivity of 0.908 and "
        "0.903 respectively, exceeding the 0.87 threshold and demonstrating adequate "
        "performance in resource-limited settings.\n\n"
        "Image quality analysis found ungradable image rates of 3.2% in academic medical "
        "centers, 4.8% in community health centers, 5.4% in FQHCs, 4.1% in private practices, "
        "and 6.1% in rural clinics. While resource-limited settings had modestly higher "
        "ungradable rates, all remained below 10% threshold for acceptable screening "
        "program performance. Importantly, ungradable rates did not correlate with patient "
        "demographics after controlling for care setting, indicating variation reflects "
        "equipment and technique differences rather than patient factors.\n\n"
        "FAIRNESS METRICS\n\n"
        "Multiple fairness metrics were evaluated:\n\n"
        "Equalized Odds: Maximum difference in true positive rate (sensitivity) across "
        "groups was 0.021 and maximum difference in false positive rate was 0.023, both "
        "well below 0.05 threshold for concerning disparity. The system achieves "
        "approximate equalized odds across demographic groups.\n\n"
        "Predictive Parity: Positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 0.72 to 0.79 "
        "across racial/ethnic groups, with variation primarily reflecting different "
        "underlying disease prevalence rates (18-22%) consistent with known epidemiology "
        "rather than model bias. PPV was calculated separately for each care setting to "
        "account for prevalence differences.\n\n"
        "Calibration: Calibration curves were examined for each demographic group and care "
        "setting. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests indicated adequate calibration for "
        "all subgroups (p>0.05), with calibration slopes ranging from 0.96 to 1.04 across "
        "groups, indicating predicted probabilities correspond well to observed outcomes "
        "consistently across populations.\n\n"
        "IDENTIFIED LIMITATIONS AND RESIDUAL DISPARITIES\n\n"
        "Despite intentional equity focus, some limitations remain. Sample sizes for "
        "American Indian/Alaska Native patients (n=476) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific "
        "Islander patients (n=198, reported in 'other' category) are smaller than other "
        "groups, leading to wider confidence intervals and less precise performance estimates. "
        "While point estimates suggest adequate performance, larger validation cohorts "
        "for these populations would enable more definitive assessment.\n\n"
        "The study did not capture sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, "
        "or primary language beyond English/Spanish. Performance for LGBTQ+ individuals, "
        "people with disabilities, and speakers of languages other than English and Spanish "

## 17.3 ONC Certification and EHR Integration

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology establishes standards for electronic health record systems through the Health IT Certification Program. While the FDA regulates AI as medical devices based on their intended use and risk, ONC certification addresses the interoperability, security, and usability of health IT including clinical decision support tools integrated into EHR workflows. For AI systems deployed within EHRs, both FDA and ONC requirements may apply depending on functionality and implementation approach.

### 17.3.1 Certification Criteria for Clinical Decision Support

The 21st Century Cures Act required ONC to update certification criteria for clinical decision support, with final rules issued in 2020 and 2023. These rules establish requirements for transparency, including predictive decision support interventions providing

 information about the intervention, the rationale or clinical evidence supporting its use, the developer or source of the intervention, and the ability for users to review and validate information used by the intervention to generate recommendations. This transparency is intended to enable clinicians to independently evaluate AI recommendations rather than blindly following algorithmic suggestions.

From an equity perspective, ONC certification requirements create important opportunities and remaining gaps. The transparency requirements could enable detection of biased recommendations if clinicians can review the data underlying predictions. However, these requirements don't mandate that training data demographics be disclosed, that performance across subgroups be documented, or that equity testing be conducted. A clinical decision support intervention could meet all ONC certification criteria while performing inequitably across patient populations as long as it provides general transparency about its development and evidence base.

### 17.3.2 Interoperability Standards and FHIR Integration

The ONC certification program requires health IT systems to implement standardized APIs enabling third-party applications to access patient data with appropriate authorization. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard has become the dominant framework for healthcare data exchange, establishing common formats for representing clinical information including patient demographics, conditions, medications, observations, and procedures.

For AI developers, FHIR compliance is essential for EHR integration but creates specific equity considerations. FHIR extension mechanisms allow systems to encode race, ethnicity, preferred language, sexual orientation, gender identity, and social determinants of health in standardized ways. However, not all EHR systems populate these fields consistently or completely. An AI system retrieving patient data via FHIR API may receive incomplete demographic information, particularly for attributes like race and ethnicity where historical documentation practices have been inconsistent. This incompleteness affects both model development and deployment monitoring.

Consider an AI system for predicting hospital readmission risk integrated with EHRs via FHIR API. During development, training data extracted from EHRs may have race documented for only 60 percent of patients, with missingness higher in community health centers than academic medical centers. This missing data pattern makes it difficult to train models that perform equitably and impossible to validate performance across racial groups using only EHR data. During deployment, the system may be unable to monitor fairness if race information isn't consistently available in the API responses.

Some developers have proposed inference approaches that predict missing demographics from available clinical data to enable fairness evaluation. However, such inference creates serious ethical concerns. Predicting race from clinical features risks reifying race as a biological rather than social construct and may reproduce stereotypes encoded in healthcare data. Using inferred demographics for fairness evaluation provides false assurance if the inference itself is biased. Most fundamentally, predicting sensitive attributes without patient knowledge or consent raises privacy concerns even when done with equity-focused intentions. Rather than inferring missing demographics, better approaches include improving data collection practices, developing fairness evaluation methods robust to missing demographic information, and being transparent about limitations of equity assessment when demographics are incomplete.

### 17.3.3 Production Implementation: FHIR-Based AI Deployment

We implement a production-ready framework for deploying AI within EHRs using FHIR APIs with comprehensive equity considerations including demographic data handling, missing data management, and continuous monitoring.

This implementation provides production-ready infrastructure for deploying AI systems via FHIR APIs with comprehensive equity monitoring despite incomplete demographic data.

## 17.4 HIPAA Compliance and Privacy Protection

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act establishes requirements for protecting patient health information, with the Privacy Rule and Security Rule defining standards for access, disclosure, and safeguarding of protected health information. AI systems that access, store, or transmit PHI must comply with HIPAA regardless of whether they are classified as medical devices requiring FDA oversight. Compliance failures can result in substantial financial penalties and reputational damage, but more importantly, privacy breaches disproportionately harm vulnerable populations.

### 17.4.1 Privacy Risks for Underserved Populations

Privacy violations in healthcare AI pose differential risks across populations. Patients from marginalized communities face particular vulnerability to harms from privacy breaches including discrimination in employment, housing, and insurance based on health conditions, immigration enforcement actions if documentation status is revealed, stigmatization and community exclusion for stigmatized conditions, intimate partner violence if health information including pregnancy or reproductive care is disclosed, and law enforcement attention for substance use or mental health conditions. These differential impacts mean that privacy protection is not just a regulatory compliance issue but a health equity imperative.

Consider an AI system predicting substance use disorder risk for targeting of intervention programs. If the system's predictions or the data it accesses are inadequately protected, the consequences differ dramatically across populations. For affluent patients with private insurance and stable housing, a privacy breach might result in embarrassment or social discomfort. For patients without legal immigration status, the same breach could lead to detention and deportation. For patients with precarious housing situations, disclosure of substance use could lead to eviction. For patients in communities heavily policed for drug offenses, the information could lead to arrest. These differential impacts mean that privacy safeguards designed around risks for the most privileged populations may be inadequate for protecting those most vulnerable.

### 17.4.2 De-Identification and Re-Identification Risks

HIPAA provides a safe harbor for de-identified data, exempting information from Privacy Rule restrictions if specific identifiers are removed and the covered entity has no actual knowledge that remaining information could identify individuals. The safe harbor method requires removing 18 specific identifiers including names, geographic subdivisions smaller than states, dates more specific than year, and other directly identifying information. Alternatively, the expert determination method allows a qualified expert to determine that the risk of re-identification is very small.

However, de-identification designed to meet HIPAA safe harbor may be inadequate for protecting patients from marginalized communities. Small demographic groups can be uniquely identifiable even after removing the specified 18 identifiers. A dataset of hospital admissions in a rural county with dates reduced to year, ages reduced to 5-year bins, and three-digit ZIP codes may still enable identification of individuals from small racial or ethnic minority communities in that county. The combination of rare conditions with demographic characteristics can be uniquely identifying even in large datasets. Recent research has demonstrated successful re-identification attacks on supposedly de-identified medical data, particularly when the data contains detailed clinical information about uncommon conditions.

### 17.4.3 Differential Privacy for Healthcare AI

Differential privacy provides mathematical guarantees that any individual's inclusion or exclusion from a dataset has limited impact on the output of analyses performed on that dataset. Formally, a randomized mechanism satisfies epsilon-differential privacy if for any two datasets differing in a single individual's data, the probability of any particular output changes by at most a multiplicative factor of e raised to the power epsilon. Smaller epsilon values provide stronger privacy guarantees but may reduce data utility.

Applying differential privacy to healthcare AI development involves adding carefully calibrated noise during training to prevent the model from memorizing individual patients' data. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent adds noise to gradient computations during training, with the noise magnitude determined by privacy parameters. The key insight is that if training algorithms are differentially private, the resulting models provide provable guarantees that they did not overfit to any individual patient's data, making membership inference attacks and reconstruction attacks more difficult.

From an equity perspective, differential privacy is particularly valuable for protecting patients from small demographic groups who are most vulnerable to re-identification. Traditional de-identification often fails to protect individuals from rare populations because removing identifying features makes those individuals stand out rather than blend in. Differential privacy's formal guarantees apply regardless of background knowledge an adversary might have, providing consistent protection across all patients. However, differential privacy can reduce model performance, and this performance cost may not be uniformly distributed across patient populations. Models trained with differential privacy may have lower accuracy for rare conditions that are more common in underrepresented groups, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities in the name of privacy protection.

Recent research has explored fairness-aware differential privacy that explicitly considers the impact of privacy mechanisms on model fairness. These approaches add constraints ensuring that privacy protection doesn't disproportionately degrade performance for any demographic group. However, such methods may require larger privacy budgets, weaker privacy guarantees, to maintain equitable performance, highlighting inherent tensions between privacy, fairness, and utility in machine learning.

## 17.5 International Regulatory Frameworks

Healthcare AI is increasingly deployed globally, requiring navigation of multiple regulatory regimes with varying approaches to medical device regulation, data protection, and algorithmic fairness. Understanding international frameworks is essential for developers planning multinational deployment and for learning from diverse regulatory approaches to equity in AI.

### 17.5.1 European Union Medical Device Regulation and AI Act

The European Union's Medical Device Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation establish comprehensive frameworks for medical device oversight including software. The MDR and IVDR introduce stricter requirements than previous directives, including enhanced clinical evidence requirements, more rigorous conformity assessment procedures, and strengthened post-market surveillance. Medical device software must undergo conformity assessment by notified bodies for higher risk classes, with technical documentation demonstrating compliance with essential requirements including safety, performance, and benefit-risk analysis.

The proposed EU AI Act goes further, establishing specific requirements for high-risk AI systems including those used in healthcare. High-risk AI systems would require conformity assessments demonstrating compliance with requirements including appropriate data governance and management practices ensuring training datasets are relevant, representative, and free of errors, adequate documentation enabling understanding of AI system functioning, robust human oversight mechanisms, appropriate accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity measures, and comprehensive logging enabling traceability of AI system decisions. Of particular relevance for health equity, the AI Act requires that training datasets be sufficiently representative of intended users and that the system's performance be evaluated for potential discriminatory impacts.

The AI Act's representativeness requirements create opportunities for advancing global health equity in medical AI. By requiring that training data reflect intended use populations and that discriminatory impacts be evaluated, the Act establishes regulatory expectations that go beyond current US requirements. However, questions remain about operationalizing these principles. What level of representativeness is sufficient? How should developers balance representativeness across multiple demographic axes? Should models with demonstrated disparities be prohibited from deployment, or can disparities be mitigated through other means like decision thresholds or human oversight? As EU regulators develop implementing guidance, their approaches may influence global standards for equity in medical AI.

### 17.5.2 UK MHRA and Canada Health Canada Frameworks

The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has developed guidance for medical device software incorporating machine learning, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating generalizability across intended populations. The MHRA framework includes requirements for dataset representativeness, performance evaluation across subgroups, monitoring for performance drift, and processes for updating algorithms while maintaining safety and effectiveness. Following Brexit, the MHRA operates independently from EU frameworks but has indicated intent to maintain high standards and international harmonization where appropriate.

Canada's Health Canada regulates medical devices under the Medical Devices Regulations, with software including AI falling under various device classes depending on risk. Health Canada has published guidance on software as a medical device emphasizing the importance of representative training data and performance evaluation across patient populations. Canadian frameworks have been particularly attentive to indigenous health, with guidance documents acknowledging the importance of ensuring medical technologies work effectively for First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis peoples who have historically experienced health disparities. This focus on indigenous health equity in regulatory frameworks provides valuable lessons for other jurisdictions.

### 17.5.3 Low and Middle Income Country Considerations

While high-income countries have established regulatory frameworks for medical devices, many low and middle income countries have more limited regulatory capacity. The World Health Organization has developed guidance to support member states in regulating medical devices, including software and AI systems. WHO's Global Model Regulatory Framework emphasizes the importance of regulation that is risk-proportionate, transparent, and tailored to local contexts including resource availability and health system capacity.

For AI developers, the varied regulatory landscape in LMICs creates both challenges and opportunities from an equity perspective. The challenge is that weak regulatory oversight may enable deployment of poorly validated systems that perform inequitably, with patients in LMICs bearing risks that would be unacceptable in high-income countries. The opportunity is that developing AI systems specifically for LMIC contexts with appropriate validation can address health needs where they are greatest. Responsible development for LMIC deployment requires going beyond minimum regulatory requirements to ensure systems are validated in the contexts where they will be used and that local expertise and community engagement inform development.

## 17.6 Conclusions

Regulatory considerations for clinical AI are inseparable from health equity concerns. The same regulatory processes that ensure safety and effectiveness must also ensure fairness and equitable benefit across all patient populations. This requires that regulatory frameworks explicitly incorporate equity considerations, that developers systematically address fairness throughout the development lifecycle, and that post-market surveillance actively monitors for disparate impacts rather than assuming aggregate performance indicates consistent benefit.

The regulatory landscape for clinical AI continues to evolve, with increasing attention to algorithmic fairness and health equity. The FDA's commitment to developing good machine learning practices addressing fairness, the EU AI Act's requirements for representative data and discrimination assessment, and WHO guidance emphasizing equity all signal recognition that technical oversight must encompass social justice considerations. However, translating these commitments into concrete requirements with effective enforcement remains an ongoing challenge.

For developers, the path forward requires engaging proactively with regulatory expectations for equity rather than treating fairness as an optional consideration or compliance burden. The frameworks and implementations presented in this chapter provide starting points for regulatory documentation that meets both legal requirements and ethical obligations to advance health equity through AI. As regulatory standards continue to evolve, maintaining vigilance about equity implications of technical choices and regulatory requirements will be essential for developing AI systems that reduce rather than perpetuate health disparities.
