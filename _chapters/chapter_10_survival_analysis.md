# Chapter 10: Survival Analysis and Time-to-Event Modeling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to implement production-grade survival analysis systems for clinical risk prediction that explicitly account for differential censoring patterns across patient populations, recognizing that loss to follow-up and incomplete observation periods often occur systematically based on race, ethnicity, insurance status, and geographic location rather than randomly. Readers will develop Cox proportional hazards models with comprehensive diagnostic testing for assumption violations including non-proportional hazards that may manifest differently across demographic subgroups, implementing stratified and time-varying coefficient approaches when standard models fail to capture heterogeneous hazard patterns across diverse populations. They will apply competing risks analysis frameworks to clinical settings where patients face multiple potential outcomes with socially determined prevalence patterns, using subdistribution hazards and cumulative incidence functions to properly account for how competing events like cardiovascular death versus cancer death vary systematically across communities experiencing different environmental and structural risk exposures.

Readers will build random survival forests and other machine learning approaches to time-to-event modeling that achieve equitable predictive performance across patient characteristics while handling complex interactions between clinical and social determinants, implementing fairness-aware extensions that prevent models from learning shortcuts based on healthcare access patterns rather than true clinical risk. They will design validation strategies for survival models that assess not only discrimination and calibration but also fairness metrics across population subgroups, with particular attention to evaluating model performance in external settings serving different patient populations than the training data, recognizing that survival model transportability is often limited by unmeasured confounding due to social determinants. Finally, readers will deploy clinical survival analysis systems with comprehensive monitoring for equity issues that can emerge post-deployment, including detecting when censoring patterns change over time in ways that differentially affect model performance for specific populations, implementing alerting systems that surface potential fairness degradation before it causes patient harm.

## 10.1 Introduction: Time-to-Event Data and Health Inequities

Time-to-event analysis addresses one of the most fundamental questions in clinical medicine: how long until an outcome occurs? Whether predicting time to death, disease progression, hospital readmission, treatment response, or any other clinical event, survival analysis provides the mathematical and statistical framework for working with data where outcomes happen at different times for different patients and where observation may be incomplete due to censoring. The methods originated in industrial reliability testing and actuarial science but found their most extensive application in biomedical research, becoming essential tools for clinical trials, prognostic modeling, and health services research (Collett, 2015; Klein & Moeschberger, 2003).

Yet time-to-event data in healthcare is far from the idealized setting of controlled clinical trials where randomization ensures balanced comparison groups and complete follow-up is achieved for all participants. In real-world clinical practice, the patterns of who experiences events and when they occur reflect not only biological disease processes but also the profound inequities embedded in healthcare delivery systems and broader social structures. Patients from marginalized communities may experience disease onset at younger ages due to cumulative exposures to structural racism and poverty. They may progress more rapidly due to barriers accessing timely care. They may be lost to follow-up more frequently because of residential instability, transportation barriers, or mistrust of medical systems built on historical exploitation. They may face competing risks like violence or drug overdose that make certain clinical outcomes impossible to observe (Williams & Mohammed, 2013; Bailey et al., 2017).

These differential patterns create profound challenges for survival analysis applied to observational healthcare data. Consider a model predicting time to kidney failure among patients with chronic kidney disease. Standard survival analysis might reveal that Black patients have substantially higher hazard of progression to end-stage renal disease compared to white patients even after adjusting for measured clinical factors like baseline kidney function and blood pressure control. A naive interpretation might attribute this to biological differences. However, closer examination might reveal that Black patients experience more frequent loss to follow-up, shorter observation periods before censoring, and higher competing mortality from cardiovascular disease during the observation period. Each of these patterns reflects structural inequities in access to nephrology care, ability to afford medications and transportation to appointments, and exposure to cardiovascular risk factors through residential segregation and environmental injustice. The observed hazard ratio conflates true differences in disease progression with differential censoring and competing risks, both of which are themselves manifestations of structural racism (Norton et al., 2016; Patzer et al., 2012).

This chapter develops survival analysis methods with explicit attention to these equity challenges. We begin with foundational concepts including the hazard function, survival function, and censoring mechanisms, but frame each through the lens of how real-world clinical data generation processes differ from idealized assumptions in ways that matter for health equity. We then develop the Cox proportional hazards model, examining in depth the proportional hazards assumption and how its violations can reflect genuine biological or social heterogeneity in disease processes across populations. We extend to time-varying covariates and coefficients, parametric survival models, competing risks analysis, and machine learning approaches to survival modeling. Throughout, we implement production-ready code with comprehensive fairness evaluation, validation strategies appropriate for diverse clinical settings, and diagnostic approaches for detecting assumption violations that may signal equity concerns. Our goal is to equip practitioners with both technical expertise in survival analysis and critical consciousness about how time-to-event modeling can either illuminate or obscure health inequities depending on how carefully we attend to the social and structural factors shaping when and for whom outcomes occur.

## 10.2 Foundations of Survival Analysis

Understanding survival analysis requires building intuition about several fundamental concepts that may seem abstract at first but become essential tools for reasoning about time-to-event data. We develop these concepts with attention to how they relate to real clinical data and the equity challenges that arise when applying survival methods to observational healthcare settings.

### 10.2.1 The Survival Function and Hazard Function

The survival function, typically denoted as S(t), represents the probability that an individual survives beyond time t without experiencing the event of interest. Mathematically, if T represents the random variable for time to event, then S(t) = P(T > t). At time zero, assuming all individuals are event-free at the start of observation, S(0) = 1, meaning everyone has survived to time zero. As time progresses, the survival function is non-increasing because once an event occurs, it cannot be reversed, at least for events like death, though recurrent events require different frameworks. Eventually, as time approaches infinity, S(t) approaches zero for mortal events, though in practice we observe survival curves over finite follow-up periods (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002).

The hazard function, denoted h(t), represents the instantaneous rate of experiencing the event at time t given survival up to that time. More precisely, the hazard function is defined as the limit of the probability of experiencing the event in a small time interval divided by the width of that interval, conditional on having survived to the beginning of the interval. Mathematically, h(t) equals the limit as Δt approaches zero of $P(t ≤ T < t + Δt \mid T ≥ t)$ divided by Δt. The hazard function captures the instantaneous risk at each moment in time, while the survival function captures the cumulative probability of surviving beyond each time point. These two functions are mathematically related through the cumulative hazard function H(t), which integrates the hazard rate over time. The cumulative hazard H(t) equals the integral from 0 to t of h(u)du. The survival function can be expressed in terms of the cumulative hazard as S(t) = exp(-H(t)). This relationship allows us to move between different representations of the time-to-event distribution, each of which provides complementary insights (Aalen et al., 2008).

In clinical applications, both functions carry important interpretation. The survival function directly answers questions like what proportion of patients will survive five years after diagnosis, or what is the median time to disease progression. These are the questions clinicians and patients typically ask when discussing prognosis. The hazard function, meanwhile, captures how risk changes over time and enables us to compare how quickly events occur between groups while accounting for different follow-up times and censoring patterns. A treatment that reduces the hazard at all time points is beneficial regardless of whether we observe long-term outcomes, making hazard-based analysis particularly valuable for chronic diseases where complete follow-up until death is impractical (Andersen & Keiding, 2012).

For equity-centered analysis, both functions reveal important patterns. Consider time to first hospitalization after initial diagnosis of heart failure. The survival curve shows what proportion of patients remain hospitalization-free over time, but may hide important heterogeneity if different populations have different baseline survival probabilities or different rates of decline. The hazard function reveals whether hospitalization risk is constant over time, increases as disease progresses, or exhibits a pattern with high early risk that decreases as surviving patients stabilize. If hazard patterns differ systematically by race or insurance status in ways not explained by measured clinical factors, this may signal differential access to outpatient heart failure management or differences in how aggressively clinicians titrate evidence-based medications across populations (Breathett et al., 2021).

### 10.2.2 Censoring and Its Implications for Equity

Censoring occurs when we do not observe the exact event time for an individual, only that the event either has not occurred by a certain time or occurred within a certain interval. Right censoring, the most common type, occurs when follow-up ends before the event occurs. An individual might reach the end of a study period, be lost to follow-up, withdraw from the study, or die from a competing cause. Left censoring occurs when the event occurred before observation began, though this is less common in prospective studies. Interval censoring occurs when we know the event happened between two observation times but not exactly when (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002).

The mathematical treatment of censoring in survival analysis typically assumes non-informative censoring, meaning that the probability of being censored at time t does not depend on the unobserved event time, conditional on measured covariates. Under non-informative censoring, individuals who are censored at time t have the same distribution of remaining survival time as individuals who remain under observation at time t with the same covariate values. This assumption enables unbiased estimation of survival functions and hazard models despite incomplete follow-up (Klein & Moeschberger, 2003).

However, the non-informative censoring assumption is frequently violated in observational healthcare data in ways that systematically differ across demographic groups, creating substantial equity concerns. Consider a study of time to viral suppression among patients initiating HIV treatment. Patients who miss follow-up appointments are censored because viral load measurements are not available. If appointment attendance differs by factors like transportation access, work schedule flexibility, housing stability, or immigration status, then censoring is informative because patients who are censored differ systematically from those who remain under observation. Moreover, if these factors correlate with adherence to antiretroviral therapy, then censored patients may have different underlying viral suppression probabilities than uncensored patients, violating the non-informative censoring assumption (Howe et al., 2016).

When censoring differs across demographic groups, standard survival analysis can produce biased estimates of group differences even when the non-informative censoring assumption holds within each group. If Black patients are censored more frequently than white patients due to residential instability or healthcare system distrust, then even if censoring is non-informative within each racial group, the survival curves will be estimated with less precision for Black patients. This differential precision translates to wider confidence intervals and reduced statistical power to detect disparities. More concerning, if the reasons for differential censoring also correlate with event risk, then censoring becomes informative and standard methods produce biased estimates of survival and hazard functions that may either underestimate or overestimate true disparities depending on the direction of association between censoring and event risk (Hernán et al., 2010).

Diagnosing and addressing informative censoring requires careful thought about the data generation process and potential use of sensitivity analyses or more sophisticated methods like inverse probability weighting that attempt to adjust for informative censoring by modeling the censoring mechanism. The first step is always descriptive analysis of censoring patterns across demographic groups and over time, examining whether censoring rates differ systematically and exploring associations between baseline characteristics and censoring. When informative censoring seems likely, sensitivity analyses that make different assumptions about the survival distribution of censored individuals can bound the range of plausible estimates. More formally, inverse probability of censoring weights can be applied where individuals are weighted by the inverse probability of remaining uncensored given their observed characteristics, in effect creating a pseudo-population where censoring is balanced across characteristics. However, these methods only adjust for measured confounders of the censoring-outcome relationship and cannot address unmeasured confounding (Robins & Finkelstein, 2000; Hernán, 2010).

### 10.2.3 The Kaplan-Meier Estimator

The Kaplan-Meier estimator provides a non-parametric method for estimating the survival function from data with right censoring. Developed independently by Kaplan and Meier in 1958, the estimator has become the standard approach for descriptive survival analysis due to its intuitive interpretation, minimal assumptions, and robustness (Kaplan & Meier, 1958).

The estimator works by partitioning the observed time period into intervals defined by the observed event times. At each event time, we calculate the conditional probability of surviving through that time given survival to just before that time. The survival probability at any time t is then estimated as the product of these conditional survival probabilities up to time t. Let t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m denote the ordered distinct event times. At each time t_k, let d_k denote the number of events occurring at t_k and n_k denote the number of individuals at risk just before t_k, meaning they have neither experienced an event nor been censored before that point. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at time t is the product over all t_k ≤ t of (1 - d_k / n_k). The term (1 - d_k / n_k) represents the conditional probability of surviving through time t_k given survival just before t_k. By multiplying these conditional survival probabilities, we obtain an estimate of survival to any time t that appropriately accounts for censoring. Individuals contribute to the risk set for all intervals before they are either censored or experience an event, then no longer contribute afterward. This allows proper handling of different follow-up times across individuals (Fleming & Harrington, 1991).

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is remarkably robust and remains the standard method for descriptive survival analysis. It makes minimal assumptions, requiring only that censoring is non-informative and that survival experience is independent across individuals. It does not assume any particular functional form for how survival changes over time, instead letting the data speak for themselves. The estimator provides a step function that jumps downward at each observed event time, with the magnitude of each jump reflecting the proportion of at-risk individuals who experienced events at that time (Efron, 1988).

Confidence intervals for the Kaplan-Meier estimator can be constructed using several approaches. The Greenwood formula provides variance estimates that account for uncertainty in the hazard estimates at each time point. The log-log transformation ensures confidence intervals remain within the valid zero to one range for probabilities. The pointwise confidence intervals answer the question of what is our uncertainty about survival probability at this specific time point. Confidence bands that maintain coverage across all time points simultaneously require wider intervals but provide stronger protection against false conclusions (Klein & Moeschberger, 2003).

For equity analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by demographic or social factors provide a powerful visual and statistical tool for identifying survival disparities. We can estimate separate survival curves for different groups and test whether they differ significantly using log-rank tests or other non-parametric comparisons. However, interpretation requires care. Observed differences in survival curves reflect both actual differences in event risk and potential differences in censoring patterns. If one group is censored more frequently and censoring is informative, the Kaplan-Meier estimator will be biased in ways that may either obscure or exaggerate true disparities. We implement the Kaplan-Meier estimator with comprehensive fairness evaluation below, examining not only whether survival differs across groups but also whether censoring patterns differ in ways that might bias group comparisons.

This implementation provides comprehensive Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with explicit attention to equity concerns. The code evaluates censoring patterns across groups and generates interpretive guidance that helps practitioners understand when observed survival differences might reflect differential censoring rather than true differences in event risk. The simulation function enables testing with realistic patterns of differential hazards and censoring that characterize real-world health disparities.

## 10.3 Cox Proportional Hazards Models

The Cox proportional hazards model represents one of the most widely used methods in survival analysis, providing a semi-parametric framework for relating covariates to event risk while accounting for censoring. Developed by David Cox in 1972, the model makes a critical assumption called proportional hazards that enables estimation without requiring specification of how the baseline hazard changes over time. Understanding this model, its assumptions, and how those assumptions can fail in ways relevant to health equity is essential for appropriate application in diverse clinical settings (Cox, 1972; Therneau & Grambsch, 2000).

### 10.3.1 Model Structure and the Proportional Hazards Assumption

The Cox model expresses the hazard function for individual i at time t as the product of a baseline hazard function that depends only on time and a multiplicative factor that depends on individual covariates. The hazard for individual i given their covariate values equals the baseline hazard multiplied by the exponential of a linear combination of covariates. If we denote the baseline hazard as h_0(t) and the covariates for individual i as X_{i1}, X_{i2}, through X_{ip} with corresponding coefficients β_1, β_2, through β_p, then the hazard function becomes h_0(t) times exp(β_1 X_{i1} + β_2 X_{i2} + ... + β_p X_{ip}). The baseline hazard h_0(t) represents the hazard function when all covariates equal zero, capturing how risk changes over time in the reference population. The exponential term multiplies this baseline hazard by a factor that depends on covariate values but is constant over time for each individual (Cox, 1972; Therneau & Grambsch, 2000).

The proportional hazards assumption requires that the ratio of hazards for any two individuals with different covariate values remains constant over time. If individual A has covariates X_A and individual B has covariates X_B, their hazard ratio equals the ratio of their hazard functions, which simplifies to exp(β_1 (X_{A1} - X_{B1}) + ... + β_p (X_{Ap} - X_{Bp})). This ratio does not depend on time t because the baseline hazard h_0(t) cancels when we divide. This proportionality allows powerful partial likelihood estimation where we can estimate the regression coefficients β without needing to specify the form of h_0(t), providing a semi-parametric approach that combines flexibility about the baseline hazard with interpretable covariate effects (Cox, 1975).

The hazard ratio interpretation is central to understanding Cox model results. If a covariate increases by one unit, the hazard is multiplied by exp(β_j) for the corresponding coefficient β_j. For a binary covariate like treatment versus control, exp(β_j) directly gives the hazard ratio comparing treated to untreated individuals. A hazard ratio of 0.5 means the treatment group has half the hazard of the control group at every time point, while a hazard ratio of 2.0 means double the hazard. Hazard ratios provide relative measures of effect that do not depend on the baseline hazard shape (Kleinbaum & Klein, 2012).

For equity-centered analysis, the proportional hazards assumption deserves critical examination. Consider a Cox model predicting time to cardiovascular events that includes race as a covariate. A significant hazard ratio for Black race might seem to indicate biological differences in cardiovascular risk. However, if the proportional hazards assumption is violated, meaning the hazard ratio changes over time, this could reflect differential patterns of healthcare access rather than constant biological differences. Perhaps Black patients face barriers to preventive cardiology care early in disease course, creating elevated hazard initially, but once enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation or specialty cardiology, the hazard ratio attenuates. Or perhaps early hazards are similar but diverge over time as cumulative exposures to neighborhood-level stressors and environmental factors mount. Either pattern violates proportional hazards and requires more sophisticated analysis to properly characterize (Hernández & Bauer, 2019).

### 10.3.2 Partial Likelihood Estimation

The Cox model's elegance lies in its partial likelihood approach to estimation, which avoids need to specify the baseline hazard function while still providing consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of the regression coefficients. The partial likelihood focuses on the ordering of events rather than their exact timing. At each event time, we consider all individuals still at risk and ask what is the probability that the individual who actually experienced the event would be the one to experience it, given that someone in the risk set will experience an event at this time (Cox, 1975).

More formally, let t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m denote the ordered distinct event times, and let R(t_k) denote the risk set at time t_k, meaning all individuals who have neither experienced an event nor been censored before time t_k. Let i(t_k) denote the individual who experiences an event at time t_k. The partial likelihood is the product over all event times of the probability that individual i(t_k) experiences the event at time t_k given that someone in R(t_k) experiences an event. Under the proportional hazards assumption, this probability equals exp(β' X_{i(t_k)}) divided by the sum over all individuals j in R(t_k) of exp(β' X_j). The partial likelihood is the product of these probabilities across all event times. Maximizing this partial likelihood yields coefficient estimates that have good asymptotic properties despite not modeling the baseline hazard (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002).

The partial likelihood approach handles censoring naturally because censored observations contribute to risk sets for all event times before their censoring time, then no longer contribute. This allows individuals with different follow-up lengths to contribute appropriately to estimation. The approach also handles tied event times, where multiple individuals experience events at the same recorded time, though different methods exist for handling ties with varying computational complexity and statistical properties. The Efron approximation provides a good balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for moderate numbers of ties (Efron, 1977).

For equity applications, understanding the partial likelihood helps clarify what the Cox model can and cannot tell us about survival patterns. The model estimates relative hazards comparing groups or associated with covariates, but does not directly estimate absolute survival probabilities or cumulative incidence. To obtain survival curve estimates, we must combine the coefficient estimates with an estimate of the baseline hazard, typically obtained through the Breslow estimator. This means Cox models are most useful for comparing hazards between groups or assessing associations between covariates and event risk, rather than predicting absolute event probabilities (Breslow, 1972).

### 10.3.3 Testing the Proportional Hazards Assumption

The proportional hazards assumption is critical for valid Cox model interpretation, yet it is often violated in ways that matter for equity analysis. Multiple approaches exist for testing proportional hazards, each providing complementary insights. Graphical assessment using log-minus-log survival plots provides visual evaluation of proportionality. Under proportional hazards, plots of log(-log(S(t))) versus log(t) for different covariate values should be approximately parallel. Non-parallel curves suggest time-varying effects (Grambsch & Therneau, 1994).

Schoenfeld residuals offer a formal test by regressing scaled Schoenfeld residuals on time. The Schoenfeld residual for covariate X and event time táµ¢ measures the difference between the observed covariate value for the individual experiencing the event and the expected value weighted by risk set probabilities. If the proportional hazards assumption holds, these residuals should show no trend over time. Regressing scaled residuals on time and testing for non-zero slope provides a formal test. Significant trends indicate non-proportional hazards for that covariate. The correlation between Schoenfeld residuals and time can be tested formally, providing p-values for each covariate (Schoenfeld, 1982; Therneau & Grambsch, 2000).

Including time interactions in the model provides another diagnostic approach. If we extend the model to include interaction terms between covariates and time or functions of time like log(t), significant interactions indicate time-varying effects. This approach not only tests but also estimates how effects change over time, providing substantive insights into the nature of non-proportionality. The interaction coefficient tells us whether the log hazard ratio is increasing or decreasing over time and at what rate (Kleinbaum & Klein, 2012).

When testing proportional hazards specifically in the context of demographic or social variables, violations often have important equity implications. If the hazard ratio for Black race versus white race decreases over time, this might indicate that initial disparities in access to diagnosis or treatment narrow as patients enter specialized care. If the hazard ratio increases over time, this might suggest that initially similar outcomes diverge as cumulative effects of structural barriers mount. Either pattern invalidates the single hazard ratio interpretation from a standard Cox model and requires more sophisticated analysis using time-varying coefficients or stratification (Hernández & Bauer, 2019).

This implementation provides comprehensive Cox proportional hazards modeling with explicit testing of assumptions and equity-focused interpretation. The proportional hazards tests using Schoenfeld residuals enable detection of time-varying effects that may have important equity implications. The equity report contextualizes findings with appropriate caution about interpretation of demographic variables and potential sources of bias.

### 10.3.4 Time-Varying Covariates and Coefficients

Many clinical variables change over time, and their effects on hazard may also vary temporally. Time-varying covariates represent measurements that can change during follow-up, such as blood pressure, medication adherence, or employment status. Time-varying coefficients allow covariate effects to change over time even when the covariate values themselves remain constant. Both extensions relax the standard proportional hazards assumption in different ways (Therneau & Grambsch, 2000).

For time-varying covariates, we modify the Cox model to allow covariate values X_i(t) that depend on time t. The hazard function becomes h_0(t) times exp(β' X_i(t)), where the covariate vector can change as time progresses. This requires restructuring the data in counting process format where each individual contributes multiple records, one for each time interval during which their covariate values remain constant. The partial likelihood extends naturally to this setting by evaluating covariate values at the time of each event (Fisher & Lin, 1999).

Time-varying coefficients address situations where the effect of a covariate on hazard changes over time. We can model this by including interactions between covariates and time or functions of time. The simplest approach specifies β(t) = β_0 + β_1 * g(t) where g(t) might be log(t), t, or other functions. The coefficient β_1 tells us how the log hazard ratio changes per unit change in g(t). Positive β_1 means the effect strengthens over time, while negative β_1 means it weakens (Perperoglou et al., 2019).

For equity applications, time-varying extensions prove essential for capturing how disparities emerge and evolve. Consider medication adherence as a time-varying covariate in a model of cardiovascular events. Adherence measurements at multiple time points allow us to assess how current adherence affects event risk while accounting for past adherence history. If adherence declines more rapidly among patients with transportation barriers or financial constraints, this time-varying relationship captures how structural inequities manifest through behavioral pathways that standard time-fixed models would miss (Ribaudo et al., 2014).

## 10.4 Competing Risks Analysis

Competing risks occur when individuals face multiple types of events where experiencing one event precludes experiencing others. In healthcare settings, competing risks are ubiquitous. Patients with chronic kidney disease face risks of kidney failure requiring dialysis, kidney transplantation, and death before either occurs. Cancer patients face risks of disease progression, death from cancer, and death from other causes. Hospitalized patients face risks of discharge, transfer to intensive care, and death (Putter et al., 2007; Austin et al., 2016).

Standard survival analysis handles competing events by treating them as censoring observations, analyzing time to one event type while censoring when other events occur. This approach answers questions about cause-specific hazards, which represent the instantaneous rate of experiencing event type k among individuals who have not yet experienced any event. Cause-specific hazards are interpretable and can be modeled using standard Cox regression (Pintilie, 2006).

However, cause-specific hazards do not directly answer the question most relevant for clinical decision-making and health services planning, which is what is the probability that an individual will experience each event type by a given time. This question requires cumulative incidence functions that account for how competing risks affect the probability of observing each outcome. When competing risks are present, simply analyzing time to event A while censoring for event B produces biased estimates of the probability of experiencing A, because some individuals censored for B would have experienced B before they could experience A (Fine & Gray, 1999).

For equity analysis, competing risks frameworks are essential because the distribution of competing events often differs systematically across demographic groups due to structural factors. Black patients with end-stage renal disease face both longer waiting times for kidney transplantation and higher mortality rates while waiting, reflecting barriers in access to transplant listing and social determinants affecting health during the waiting period (Patzer et al., 2012). Simply analyzing time to transplant while treating death as censoring would incorrectly suggest transplant probabilities, obscuring how mortality competing risk reduces actual transplant receipt. Similarly, when studying time to cardiovascular events, populations experiencing higher rates of violence or drug overdose deaths face different competing risk profiles that affect observed cardiovascular event probabilities (Bibbins-Domingo, 2019).

### 10.4.1 Cumulative Incidence Functions

The cumulative incidence function for event type k, denoted as F_k(t), represents the probability of experiencing event type k by time t, accounting for competing risks. Unlike the standard survival analysis survival function, which assumes individuals censored for competing events remain at risk indefinitely, the CIF acknowledges that competing events eliminate future risk of the event of interest (Satagopan et al., 2004).

Mathematically, the cumulative incidence function integrates the cause-specific hazard weighted by the overall survival probability. The CIF equals the integral from 0 to t of the overall survival function S(u) times the cause-specific hazard h_k(u) with respect to u. The overall survival function S(u) represents the probability of surviving all event types up to time u, while h_k(u) is the instantaneous rate of experiencing event type k at time u among those who have not yet experienced any event. The product captures that for event k to occur at time u, an individual must first survive all events up to time u and then experience event k at that moment (Putter et al., 2007).

The Aalen-Johansen estimator provides a non-parametric approach to estimating cumulative incidence functions that parallels the Kaplan-Meier estimator for standard survival analysis. At each event time, we calculate the conditional probability of each event type occurring given survival to that time, then aggregate these probabilities over time. The estimator handles competing risks naturally by tracking transitions to each event type separately while accounting for the fact that experiencing one event precludes experiencing others (Aalen & Johansen, 1978; Andersen & Keiding, 2012).

For equity applications, comparing cumulative incidence curves across demographic groups reveals how competing risk profiles differ in ways that affect realized outcomes. If marginalized populations face higher mortality rates while waiting for kidney transplantation, their cumulative incidence of transplantation will be lower even if their hazard of transplantation conditional on surviving remains equal to advantaged populations. The CIF captures this combined effect of differential hazards for both the event of interest and competing events, providing a more complete picture of disparities than cause-specific hazards alone (Austin et al., 2016).

This competing risks implementation provides comprehensive analysis of settings where patients face multiple potential outcomes. The Aalen-Johansen estimator properly accounts for how competing events affect cumulative incidence probabilities. The equity report highlights how competing risk profiles may differ across populations due to structural factors, emphasizing that standard survival analysis can obscure important disparities when competing events occur at different rates across demographic groups.

## 10.5 Machine Learning for Survival Analysis

Traditional parametric and semi-parametric survival models like Cox proportional hazards make strong assumptions about functional forms and covariate effects. Machine learning approaches offer flexibility to capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions without requiring explicit specification of functional forms. Random survival forests, gradient boosting for survival, and neural network approaches extend tree-based methods, ensemble learning, and deep learning to time-to-event settings while handling censoring appropriately (Ishwaran et al., 2008; Katzman et al., 2018).

For equity-focused applications, machine learning survival models present both opportunities and risks. The flexibility to capture complex interactions may enable better modeling of how social and clinical factors jointly affect outcomes in ways that linear models miss. However, this same flexibility creates risk that models will learn shortcuts based on patterns reflecting healthcare access inequities rather than true clinical risk. Without explicit fairness constraints, machine learning survival models may amplify existing disparities by achieving higher predictive accuracy for well-documented majority populations while performing poorly for under-represented groups (Obermeyer et al., 2019).

### 10.5.1 Random Survival Forests

Random survival forests extend the random forest algorithm to time-to-event data by adapting the splitting criteria, prediction aggregation, and performance evaluation to handle censoring. Each tree in the forest is grown using a bootstrap sample of the training data, with splits chosen to maximize separation of survival curves rather than minimize classification error or regression residuals (Ishwaran et al., 2008).

The log-rank splitting rule evaluates candidate splits by computing the log-rank test statistic comparing survival curves in daughter nodes. Splits that create larger differences in survival between nodes are preferred, enabling the algorithm to discover complex interactions between covariates that affect survival patterns. Alternative splitting rules based on likelihood or conservation of events can be used depending on the application (Ishwaran & Kogalur, 2007).

Prediction from random survival forests aggregates information across trees. For a new individual, we can predict the cumulative hazard function by averaging cumulative hazard estimates from all trees where that individual lands in a particular terminal node. This produces a flexible estimate of the survival function that does not assume proportional hazards or any parametric form. We can also compute variable importance measures that quantify how much each covariate contributes to prediction accuracy, providing insights into which factors most strongly affect survival (Ishwaran et al., 2008).

For fairness-aware random survival forests, we implement several adaptations. First, we stratify training data sampling to ensure adequate representation of all demographic groups in bootstrap samples, preventing models from being dominated by majority populations. Second, we evaluate prediction performance separately within demographic subgroups to detect disparate performance that aggregate metrics might hide. Third, we implement fairness-aware variable importance that examines whether certain variables contribute disproportionately to predictions for specific groups, potentially indicating reliance on proxies for access rather than clinical risk. Fourth, we apply calibration analysis within subgroups to ensure predicted survival probabilities match observed outcomes across diverse populations (Pfohl et al., 2019).

This random survival forest implementation provides comprehensive machine learning for survival analysis with explicit fairness evaluation. The code assesses performance separately within demographic subgroups, examines feature importance for potential reliance on access proxies, and generates interpretive guidance for understanding when flexible models might perpetuate rather than address health inequities.

## 10.6 Production Deployment and Fairness Monitoring

Deploying survival analysis models in clinical settings requires more than demonstrating good performance on held-out test data. Production systems must maintain equitable performance over time as patient populations evolve, data quality changes, censoring patterns shift, and the healthcare environment transforms. This section addresses the technical and organizational considerations for deploying survival models with continuous fairness monitoring that can detect emerging equity issues before they cause patient harm (Challen et al., 2019; Benjamens et al., 2020).

### 10.6.1 Model Deployment Architecture

Production survival analysis systems require careful architectural design that separates concerns of data ingestion, feature engineering, model inference, and results delivery while maintaining comprehensive logging and monitoring at each stage. The system must handle both batch prediction for retrospective risk stratification and real-time prediction at point of care. Input data validation ensures incoming features meet expected distributions and quality standards before reaching the model. Feature engineering pipelines must replicate exactly the transformations applied during model development, with particular attention to handling missing data consistently. Model versioning enables rollback if issues emerge and supports A/B testing of model updates (Paleyes et al., 2022).

For fairness-aware deployment, the architecture must additionally track protected attributes throughout the pipeline even when these attributes are not model inputs, enabling stratified performance monitoring. The system logs all predictions with associated protected attributes, timestamps, and feature values in a format that supports retrospective fairness audits. Prediction confidence or uncertainty estimates accompany point predictions to support appropriate use by clinicians. The system implements appropriate access controls to prevent misuse of sensitive predictions while enabling necessary monitoring and evaluation (Selbst et al., 2019).

### 10.6.2 Continuous Fairness Monitoring

Once deployed, survival models require continuous monitoring to detect equity issues that can emerge over time. Monitoring systems track multiple dimensions of model performance and fairness, computing metrics separately within demographic subgroups at regular intervals. Key monitoring targets include discrimination metrics like concordance index stratified by protected attributes, calibration within subgroups comparing predicted to observed survival, censoring rates that may change differentially across groups, and the distribution of predicted risks to detect if the model begins concentrating predictions away from certain populations (Pfohl et al., 2019).

Statistical process control methods adapted for fairness monitoring can detect when performance gaps between groups exceed expected variation, triggering alerts for human review. Sequential testing procedures enable rapid detection of fairness degradation while controlling false positive rates. The monitoring system must distinguish between true model degradation and expected statistical variation, avoiding alert fatigue while remaining sensitive to meaningful changes (Challen et al., 2019).

Beyond automated monitoring, regular manual audits examine model behavior in depth, investigating specific cases where predictions may have led to inequitable care, analyzing whether feature importance has shifted in concerning directions, and soliciting feedback from clinicians and patients about model utility and fairness. These qualitative assessments complement quantitative metrics by surfacing issues that numbers alone might miss (Selbst et al., 2019).

### 10.6.3 Response Protocols for Fairness Degradation

When monitoring systems detect potential fairness issues, organizations need predefined response protocols that specify who is notified, what investigative steps occur, what actions might be taken, and how decisions are documented. Response protocols should distinguish between different severity levels, with immediate model disabling for severe fairness violations but graduated responses for less urgent concerns. Investigation protocols examine whether detected issues reflect true model problems versus changes in data quality, patient population, or clinical practice patterns (Liu et al., 2020).

Potential responses to confirmed fairness issues include model retraining with updated data that better represents affected populations, adjusting decision thresholds differently across groups if ethically appropriate and legally permissible, supplementing model predictions with additional human review for affected populations, or temporarily disabling the model for affected populations while issues are addressed. Each response has different implications for equity, clinical workflow, and legal risk that must be carefully weighed (Challen et al., 2019).

Documentation of fairness incidents, investigations, and responses serves multiple purposes. It creates institutional memory about equity challenges and effective responses, provides evidence of good faith efforts to address fairness for regulatory and legal purposes, enables learning across organizations facing similar challenges, and demonstrates accountability to patients and communities. Transparency about fairness monitoring and response protocols, appropriate to the clinical context, builds trust and enables external stakeholders to hold organizations accountable (Selbst et al., 2019).

This monitoring implementation provides comprehensive infrastructure for maintaining fairness in deployed survival models. The system tracks multiple dimensions of performance and equity, generates alerts when concerns emerge, and creates documentation to support organizational accountability and continuous improvement.

## 10.7 Conclusion

This chapter developed comprehensive methods for survival analysis applied to time-to-event data in healthcare settings, with explicit attention throughout to equity challenges that arise when censoring patterns, competing risks, and hazard structures differ systematically across demographic groups. We began with foundational concepts of survival and hazard functions, the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and the critical role of censoring assumptions, always framing these technical concepts through the lens of how real-world healthcare data generation processes reflect structural inequities rather than idealized statistical assumptions.

We developed the Cox proportional hazards model as the workhorse of survival regression, examining in depth how the proportional hazards assumption can be violated in ways that signal differential access to care or cumulative effects of structural barriers rather than constant biological differences. We extended to time-varying covariates and coefficients that capture how clinical and social factors evolve over follow-up periods, and to parametric survival models that make stronger distributional assumptions in exchange for more precise estimates when those assumptions hold. We covered competing risks analysis that properly accounts for how multiple potential outcomes affect observed event probabilities, critical for settings where competing events like cardiovascular death versus cancer death occur at different rates across demographic groups. We implemented machine learning approaches to survival analysis including random survival forests that offer flexibility to capture complex patterns but require explicit fairness evaluation to prevent learning shortcuts based on healthcare access. Finally, we addressed production deployment with continuous fairness monitoring, recognizing that equity is not established once but must be maintained throughout the model lifecycle through systematic monitoring and responsive action.

The methods and implementations in this chapter equip practitioners to conduct rigorous survival analysis that surfaces rather than obscures health inequities, to critically evaluate whether observed time-to-event patterns reflect disease biology versus structural barriers to care, and to deploy prediction systems that maintain equitable performance across diverse patient populations. The code examples provide production-ready implementations with comprehensive documentation, error handling, and fairness evaluation appropriate for clinical deployment after validation. Most fundamentally, this chapter emphasizes that every technical decision in survival modeling, from choice of methods to handling of censoring to interpretation of results, ultimately has clinical and ethical implications with differential impacts across populations. Bringing this critical consciousness to time-to-event analysis is essential for developing systems that advance rather than undermine health equity.
