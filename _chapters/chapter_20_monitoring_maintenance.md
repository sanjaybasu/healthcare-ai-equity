# Chapter 20: Ethical Frameworks for Healthcare AI Development

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

1. Apply established ethical frameworks including principlist bioethics, capabilities approach, and theories of justice to healthcare AI development, recognizing how these frameworks yield different conclusions when applied to questions of algorithmic fairness and resource allocation.

2. Design and implement community-based participatory research processes for healthcare AI development that meaningfully engage affected populations in shaping research priorities, model design decisions, and deployment strategies rather than treating community input as a token consultation step.

3. Conduct systematic benefit-risk analyses that explicitly examine how potential benefits and harms of AI systems are distributed across populations, with particular attention to whether systems that improve aggregate outcomes may nonetheless widen disparities for marginalized groups.

4. Identify and address power imbalances inherent in healthcare AI development, including asymmetries between technology developers and clinical users, between healthcare institutions and patients, and between well-resourced research settings and under-resourced communities where tools may ultimately be deployed.

5. Navigate tensions between competing ethical principles such as individual autonomy versus population benefit, privacy versus learning health systems, and innovation urgency versus precautionary approaches, using structured deliberation frameworks that make value trade-offs explicit and defensible.

6. Implement production-grade ethical assessment tools including stakeholder analysis frameworks, fairness impact assessments, and ongoing monitoring systems that surface ethical issues before they cause patient harm.

## 20.1 Introduction: Why Technical Solutions Are Insufficient for Ethical AI

The preceding chapters of this textbook have developed sophisticated technical methods for detecting and mitigating bias in healthcare AI systems, from fairness-aware learning algorithms to calibration techniques that work across diverse populations to uncertainty quantification methods that can flag predictions requiring additional scrutiny. These technical tools are essential but fundamentally insufficient for ensuring that healthcare AI advances rather than undermines health equity. The limitation is not a failure of technical rigor but rather a category error: ethical questions cannot be resolved through technical means alone because they require value judgments about what constitutes fairness, whose interests should be prioritized when conflicts arise, and what trade-offs between competing goods are acceptable.

Consider the seemingly straightforward technical problem of selecting a fairness metric for a clinical risk prediction model. The algorithmic fairness literature has demonstrated that different fairness metrics are mutually incompatible except in special cases, meaning that optimizing for one definition of fairness necessarily comes at the cost of another (Chouldechova, 2017; Kleinberg et al., 2017). A model might achieve demographic parity, meaning that the proportion of patients flagged as high-risk is equal across racial groups, but fail to achieve equalized odds, meaning that false positive and false negative rates differ by race. Conversely, a model satisfying equalized odds may assign very different proportions of patients to the high-risk category across groups.

The choice between these metrics is not a technical question that can be resolved by measuring which achieves better aggregate performance. Rather, it is fundamentally an ethical and political question about what we value. Demographic parity embodies a principle of equal treatment, holding that healthcare resources or interventions should be allocated to groups in proportion to their size in the population. Equalized odds instead embodies equal accuracy, ensuring that the model's error rates do not systematically disadvantage particular groups. Predictive parity, yet another fairness criterion, focuses on ensuring that a given risk score means the same thing across groups in terms of actual probability of the outcome.

Each of these metrics aligns with different ethical principles and will be preferred by different stakeholders depending on their values and their position relative to the system. Patients from historically marginalized groups who have experienced systematic underdiagnosis and undertreatment may prioritize metrics that ensure they receive proportionate access to preventive interventions even if this means higher false positive rates. Healthcare systems facing resource constraints may prefer metrics that minimize overall error rates to make best use of limited clinical capacity. Advocacy organizations focused on discrimination may emphasize metrics that detect and prevent disparate treatment. These are legitimate differences in values, not technical misunderstandings that can be resolved by better education or more sophisticated algorithms.

The situation becomes more complex when we recognize that the very framing of what outcomes we should predict and optimize for is itself value-laden. Should a hospital readmission prediction model aim to minimize readmissions overall, reduce disparities in readmission rates, or identify patients who would benefit most from additional support services? Each objective treats health equity differently and will lead to different model designs and different impacts on patient populations. A model optimized purely for reducing aggregate readmissions might concentrate resources on patients most likely to be compliant with discharge instructions, systematically underserving patients facing social barriers that make compliance more difficult. A model designed to reduce disparities might allocate more resources to groups with historically higher readmission rates, but could be criticized for statistical discrimination if group membership rather than individual need drives resource allocation. A model focused on identifying patients who would benefit most requires making assumptions about treatment effect heterogeneity that may not be well-supported by available data.

The ethical challenges extend beyond technical fairness metrics to fundamental questions about the appropriate role of prediction in clinical decision-making. Predictive models by their nature make probabilistic statements about individuals based on patterns learned from population data. This creates inherent tensions with medical ethics principles of respect for persons and individualized care. When a model assigns a patient a high predicted risk of hospital readmission based partly on neighborhood-level social determinants data, is this an appropriate use of evidence-based medicine to target preventive resources where they are most needed, or is it unjust statistical discrimination that treats individuals as mere instances of population categories? The answer depends on ethical commitments about the proper scope of medical decision-making, the legitimacy of using group-level information in individual decisions, and whose perspective should be privileged when stakeholders disagree.

These are not abstract philosophical puzzles but rather urgent practical questions that arise daily in healthcare AI development and deployment. Every technical design choice encodes ethical assumptions, whether explicitly acknowledged or not. The selection of training data, the choice of outcome variables, the specification of model architecture, the setting of decision thresholds, and the design of human-AI interaction interfaces all embody value judgments with differential impacts across patient populations. When these judgments remain implicit, they tend to default to the values and interests of model developers, healthcare institutions, and payers rather than patients and communities most affected by the systems.

This chapter develops ethical frameworks and practical processes for making value judgments in healthcare AI development more explicit, more rigorous, and more inclusive of diverse stakeholder perspectives. We begin by examining established ethical frameworks from bioethics, political philosophy, and technology ethics, analyzing what each framework implies for healthcare AI and where frameworks conflict in their recommendations. We then develop participatory processes for meaningful stakeholder engagement that go beyond superficial consultation to genuine shared decision-making about model design and deployment. We provide methods for systematic benefit-risk analysis that examines distributional effects rather than just aggregate outcomes. We address power imbalances that shape whose values are reflected in AI systems and who bears the risks of system failures. Finally, we develop structured deliberation frameworks for navigating tensions between competing ethical principles when no solution satisfies all stakeholders.

Throughout this chapter, we emphasize that ethical healthcare AI requires ongoing deliberation and accountability rather than one-time assessments. Ethical issues evolve as systems are deployed in new contexts, as patient populations change, and as social understanding of fairness and justice develops. The frameworks and tools we present are not solutions that resolve ethical questions permanently but rather structured processes for making ethical reasoning transparent, inclusive, and responsive to emerging concerns. The goal is not to eliminate ethical disagreement, which often reflects legitimate differences in values, but rather to ensure that disagreements are surfaced early, taken seriously, and resolved through defensible processes that respect the moral agency of affected communities.

## 20.2 Principlist Bioethics and Its Application to Healthcare AI

Principlist bioethics, as articulated by Beauchamp and Childress in their foundational work on medical ethics, organizes ethical reasoning around four core principles: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019). This framework has dominated medical ethics discourse for decades and provides a natural starting point for ethical analysis of healthcare AI. However, applying these principles to algorithmic systems reveals both their utility and their limitations, particularly regarding questions of health equity and the distribution of benefits and burdens across populations.

### 20.2.1 Respect for Autonomy in Algorithmic Clinical Decision Support

Respect for autonomy requires that patients be treated as self-governing agents capable of making informed decisions about their own healthcare. This principle underlies requirements for informed consent, truth-telling, and respect for patient treatment preferences. In the context of healthcare AI, autonomy raises questions about transparency, explainability, and the appropriate role of algorithms in clinical decision-making.

When algorithmic predictions inform clinical decisions, does respect for autonomy require disclosing to patients that AI systems were involved? If so, at what level of detail must the model be explained? Courts and regulatory bodies have increasingly affirmed a right to explanation when algorithmic systems affect important decisions, but the operationalization of this right remains contested (Selbst & Barocas, 2018). A patient told that their predicted readmission risk is seventy-three percent might reasonably ask what factors drove this prediction and whether it applies to their individual circumstances rather than merely representing their similarity to previous patients with similar characteristics.

The tension becomes particularly acute when algorithmic systems operate at the population level, making decisions about resource allocation or screening eligibility that individual patients may never know affected them. A patient denied enrollment in a care management program because an algorithm predicted low likelihood of benefit from the intervention has been subjected to a decision that constrains their autonomy yet may be entirely unaware that an algorithmic system was involved. The principle of respect for autonomy might seem to require notification and opportunity for appeal, yet such requirements could make population health management computationally infeasible if every algorithmic decision required individual review.

These tensions are especially salient for marginalized populations who have legitimate reasons to distrust medical institutions and may view algorithmic decision-making with skepticism. Black patients aware of the history of medical exploitation and discrimination, from the Tuskegee syphilis study to contemporary disparities in pain management and surgical care, may reasonably be less willing to accept algorithmic recommendations that they cannot evaluate or contest (Vyas et al., 2020). Respect for autonomy in these contexts requires not just disclosure but meaningful opportunity for patients to understand, question, and reject algorithmic inputs to their care. However, providing such opportunities imposes costs that may be particularly burdensome for under-resourced healthcare settings serving these very populations.

The implementation challenge is developing AI systems that enhance rather than undermine patient autonomy. This requires transparency about when and how algorithms inform decisions, explanations calibrated to patient health literacy and preferences, mechanisms for patients to provide input that modifies algorithmic recommendations, and respect for patient decisions to opt out of algorithmic decision support where feasible. We develop production systems for these capabilities below, recognizing that technical solutions alone cannot resolve the underlying ethical tensions.

### 20.2.2 Beneficence and Non-Maleficence: Balancing Benefits and Risks

The principles of beneficence and non-maleficence require acting in patients' best interests and avoiding harm. For healthcare AI, this directs attention to empirical questions about whether models actually improve patient outcomes and distributional questions about who benefits and who may be harmed. The challenge is that aggregate evidence of benefit may coexist with systematic harm to particular patient subgroups.

A clinical decision support system that improves antibiotic prescribing appropriateness overall, reducing both overuse in viral infections and underuse in bacterial infections, might nonetheless increase disparities if its performance is substantially worse for patients with limited English proficiency who have less complete medical histories documented in the electronic health record. From an aggregate beneficence perspective, the system produces net benefit and should be deployed. From a non-maleficence perspective focused on vulnerable populations, the system causes preventable harm and should not be deployed until its performance is equitable. Which principle should take precedence?

The classical formulation offers limited guidance because beneficence and non-maleficence are usually understood to apply at the individual patient level rather than across populations. Yet algorithmic systems inherently make trade-offs across populations based on how they are trained and optimized. A model that minimizes overall error will have higher error rates for underrepresented groups if those groups have less training data or systematically different outcome distributions. Preventing this harm requires constraining model optimization, which reduces aggregate benefit. The question becomes whether the magnitude of benefit to the majority justifies the magnitude of harm to vulnerable minorities.

For marginalized populations that have historically borne disproportionate burdens of medical research without proportionate benefits, there are strong arguments for prioritizing non-maleficence even at costs to aggregate beneficence. The principle of non-maleficence is sometimes stated as primum non nocere, first do no harm, suggesting lexical priority over beneficence when they conflict. Under such priority, no amount of aggregate benefit would justify systematic harm to already disadvantaged groups (Powers & Faden, 2006). This represents a deontological constraint on utilitarian optimization of overall outcomes.

However, strict prioritization of non-maleficence creates its own ethical challenges. If we insist that no subgroup can have worse outcomes with AI deployment than without it, we may be unable to deploy systems that would generate substantial benefits for other populations. This seems particularly problematic when the alternative to AI deployment is not perfect equitable care but rather existing human decision-making that also exhibits bias and disparities. The question is not whether AI is perfectly fair in absolute terms but whether it is fairer than feasible alternatives.

We implement tools below for systematic benefit-risk analysis that quantifies the magnitude of benefits and harms across populations, makes distributional effects explicit, and supports deliberation about acceptable trade-offs. These tools do not resolve the ethical question of how much benefit to some justifies how much harm to others, but they make the empirical stakes of different ethical positions clear and enable deliberation to proceed with common understanding of the consequences of different choices.

### 20.2.3 Justice: Distributive Justice and Fair Access to Healthcare AI

The principle of justice in healthcare ethics traditionally focuses on fair distribution of scarce medical resources and ensuring that benefits and burdens of medical interventions are allocated fairly. For healthcare AI, this raises questions about access to AI-enhanced care, the distribution of benefits from AI across populations, and whether AI systems tend to widen or narrow existing health disparities.

Access to AI-enhanced care is not uniformly distributed. Academic medical centers and well-resourced health systems have access to latest AI technologies for clinical decision support, while community health centers and rural hospitals serving underserved populations often lack the technical infrastructure, financial resources, and expertise to implement such systems. This creates a pattern where AI advances may initially benefit already well-served populations while underserved populations continue to rely on standard care. Even when AI systems eventually diffuse to all settings, the delay means that disparities are widened during the diffusion period.

Within settings that do deploy AI, questions of distributive justice arise regarding how limited resources enhanced by AI should be allocated. If an AI system identifies one thousand high-risk patients but a hospital's care management program can serve only two hundred, how should those two hundred be selected? A purely utilitarian approach might serve patients where interventions are predicted to be most effective, but this could systematically exclude patients with complex social needs whose outcomes are harder to improve. A prioritarian approach that gives extra weight to worst-off patients might serve those with greatest medical and social complexity, but this could mean helping fewer total patients if resources are spread too thin. An egalitarian approach might randomly select from all high-risk patients, but this seems to waste information about where interventions are likely to be effective.

These questions connect to broader debates in distributive justice about how to weigh aggregate welfare against distributive concerns. Utilitarian theories focus on maximizing total or average welfare, which implies that resources should go where they can do the most good regardless of current distribution. Prioritarian theories hold that improvements to worse-off individuals count for more morally than equivalent improvements to better-off individuals, implying that resources should preferentially flow to disadvantaged groups even if smaller absolute benefits result (Parfit, 1997). Egalitarian theories focus on equalizing outcomes or opportunities rather than maximizing aggregate benefit. Sufficientarian theories emphasize ensuring all individuals reach some threshold level of wellbeing rather than trying to equalize above that threshold (Frankfurt, 2015).

For healthcare AI specifically, these different distributive theories yield different implications. A utilitarian approach suggests AI should be deployed wherever it generates largest health improvements, which may mean prioritizing settings and populations where data quality is good and baseline care is already fairly strong since these are conditions where models are most likely to be accurate and actionable. A prioritarian or egalitarian approach suggests AI should preferentially be deployed in settings serving disadvantaged populations even if technical challenges make models less accurate in these settings, because the moral value of health improvements is greater for worse-off populations. A sufficientarian approach might focus AI resources on ensuring all populations reach adequate levels of care quality before pursuing further improvements for already well-served populations.

The ethical challenge is that people's intuitions about distributive justice may depend on how questions are framed and may vary across domains. When asked abstractly about fair distribution of health benefits, many people endorse prioritizing worst-off populations. But when asked about allocation of their own healthcare system's limited resources, people may be more utilitarian in seeking to maximize total benefit. These framings reflect different ethical perspectives: the first takes an impartial view of justice asking how a fair society would distribute healthcare resources, while the second takes the perspective of a particular institution with responsibility to serve its own patients well.

For healthcare AI developers working in particular institutional contexts, there is often pressure to maximize benefit for their own institution's patients rather than taking a societal view of equitable distribution. This creates systematic bias toward developing and deploying AI in settings where it will perform best technically and generate most benefit for the deploying institution, which typically means settings that are already well-resourced and serving relatively advantaged populations. Counteracting this bias requires institutional commitments to health equity that accept lower institutional performance in order to advance fairness at societal level. Such commitments are easiest to sustain when motivated by ethical frameworks that provide principled reasons for accepting these trade-offs.

We develop structured frameworks below for analyzing distributive justice implications of healthcare AI systems, examining not just who benefits from a particular system but who benefits from the overall pattern of AI development and deployment across the healthcare ecosystem. These analyses reveal that seemingly neutral technical decisions about where to focus development efforts and which populations to prioritize for validation studies have profound distributive justice implications that often run counter to stated commitments to health equity.

## 20.3 Capabilities Approach and Structural Justice Frameworks

While principlist bioethics provides useful tools for analyzing healthcare AI, its focus on individual-level principles can obscure structural factors that shape patterns of benefit and harm across populations. The capabilities approach developed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum offers a complementary framework that focuses on what people are actually able to do and become rather than just formal rights or resource allocation (Sen, 1999; Nussbaum, 2011). For healthcare AI, this directs attention to whether systems expand or constrain the real capabilities of diverse populations to live healthy lives.

### 20.3.1 The Capabilities Approach Applied to Healthcare AI

The capabilities approach asks not just whether people have formal access to healthcare AI but whether they have substantive capability to benefit from it. A clinical decision support system that provides recommendations in English to physicians is formally available to all patients those physicians treat, but patients with limited English proficiency may lack capability to meaningfully engage with treatment recommendations if communication is inadequate. An AI-enabled telehealth system is formally accessible to all patients with smartphones, but patients who lack digital literacy or lack private spaces for confidential video consultations may lack the capability to effectively use such systems.

This framework reveals how healthcare AI can widen disparities even when access appears equitable on paper. If AI systems require infrastructure, knowledge, or social resources that are unequally distributed, then nominally equal access results in unequal capability to benefit. The ethical question is not whether everyone has the same formal opportunity to use AI-enhanced care but whether everyone has the real capability to do so.

The capabilities approach is particularly illuminating for understanding how AI systems can perpetuate or disrupt structural inequities. Structural inequities are patterns of systematic disadvantage that arise from social institutions, policies, and norms rather than from individual prejudice or explicit discrimination (Young, 1990). These include residential segregation that concentrates poverty and limits access to healthcare resources, employment discrimination that affects health insurance and ability to take time off for medical appointments, educational inequities that shape health literacy and ability to navigate complex healthcare systems, and mass incarceration that disrupts social networks and imposes health consequences that persist long after release.

Healthcare AI systems that treat these structural factors as fixed patient characteristics to be predicted around rather than as mutable conditions to be changed risk reinforcing the very inequities they should help address. A readmission prediction model that includes neighborhood-level measures of poverty and crime rates may accurately identify high-risk patients, but if predictions lead only to individual-level interventions rather than efforts to address underlying social determinants, the model helps providers manage structural inequities rather than change them. This is not ethically neutral even if predictions are technically accurate and individually beneficial.

The capabilities approach suggests that ethical healthcare AI should aim to expand capabilities rather than merely accommodate existing limitations. This might mean designing systems that actively work to reduce barriers to care rather than optimizing within current constraints. An AI-powered language translation system integrated into clinical encounters expands capabilities of patients with limited English proficiency to communicate with providers, potentially reducing disparities. An AI system that helps under-resourced clinics efficiently apply for grant funding to address patients' social needs expands organizational capabilities to address health-related social needs. An AI tool that identifies when clinical guidelines developed for well-resourced populations may not apply to resource-constrained settings expands provider capabilities to deliver guideline-concordant care adapted to local constraints.

This perspective has profound implications for how we evaluate healthcare AI systems. Rather than asking only whether predictions are accurate or whether interventions triggered by predictions improve outcomes, we should ask whether systems expand the capabilities of individuals and communities to live healthy lives. This includes examining whether systems help reduce dependence on healthcare services by addressing social determinants rather than just helping healthcare systems more efficiently manage disease. It includes asking whether systems expand provider capabilities to practice in ways consistent with their professional values and patient advocacy commitments. It includes considering whether systems expand community capabilities for collective action to address structural health determinants.

### 20.3.2 Structural Justice and the Distribution of AI Development Resources

Iris Marion Young's conception of structural justice focuses on how social structures produce systematic patterns of advantage and disadvantage rather than focusing only on distribution of resources at a single point in time (Young, 2011). Applied to healthcare AI, this directs attention to the structural factors that shape what kinds of AI systems get developed, for whose benefit, and who participates in development processes.

The overwhelming majority of healthcare AI research and development occurs in well-resourced academic medical centers and technology companies based in wealthy countries, focusing on diseases and populations where abundant high-quality data are available and where commercial markets justify development costs. This creates a structural pattern where AI innovation disproportionately serves already well-served populations while populations with greatest health needs receive least attention from AI developers. The pattern arises not from deliberate discrimination but from structural factors including concentration of AI expertise and computational resources in wealthy institutions, research funding structures that reward high-impact publications in prestigious journals rather than practical tools for underserved populations, and commercial incentives that direct development toward lucrative markets.

Young's framework emphasizes that addressing structural injustice requires examining and changing the background conditions and institutional practices that produce unjust patterns, not just redistributing outcomes after the fact. For healthcare AI, this implies that equity requires not just evaluating completed systems for bias but changing the structures that determine what systems get built and how development processes work. This includes diversifying who participates in AI development through training programs and funding mechanisms that support researchers from underrepresented groups and from under-resourced institutions, changing publication and funding incentives to reward research addressing health equity even when such research faces technical challenges that may limit publication in top-tier venues, requiring data sharing and open source code release to enable researchers without access to large proprietary datasets to contribute to the field, and changing procurement and reimbursement policies to make it financially viable to develop AI tools for under-resourced settings even when market returns are limited.

These structural interventions are more difficult and less immediately satisfying than technical fixes to bias in existing models, but they are essential for long-term equity in healthcare AI. Without changing the structures that determine whose health problems receive attention from AI developers, technical fixes risk playing an endless game of whack-a-mole, finding and fixing biases in particular systems while the overall pattern of development continues to neglect needs of underserved populations.

### 20.3.3 Procedural Justice and Meaningful Stakeholder Participation

Beyond distributive justice concerns about who benefits from healthcare AI, procedural justice focuses on who gets to participate in decisions about AI development and deployment (Tyler, 1988). The capabilities approach and structural justice frameworks both emphasize that justice requires meaningful participation in decisions affecting one's life, not just receiving benefits or avoiding harms determined by others.

For healthcare AI, this raises questions about who participates in defining research questions, who reviews and approves model designs, who monitors deployed systems, and who has authority to shut down or modify systems that perform problematically. Current practice typically concentrates decision-making authority among AI developers, clinical champions, and healthcare executives while limiting participation of frontline clinicians, patients, and communities to consultative roles at best.

Procedural injustice is particularly salient for underserved populations who have historically been subjects of research rather than partners in research, excluded from decision-making about policies and technologies affecting their communities. The history of exploitative medical research on marginalized populations, from the Tuskegee study to contemporary controversies over use of clinical data from under-resourced safety net hospitals to train commercial AI systems, creates legitimate distrust of research institutions and technology developers (Washington, 2006; Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016).

Procedural justice requires going beyond superficial consultation to meaningful participation where affected communities have genuine power to shape development priorities, model design decisions, and deployment strategies. This is distinct from participatory design methods that seek user input to improve system usability, which still concentrates decision authority with developers who decide whether and how to incorporate user input. Genuine procedural justice requires sharing decision authority, which means affected communities must be able to reject proposed systems, require modifications, or redirect development priorities even when this conflicts with developer preferences.

Such power-sharing is rare in current healthcare AI practice. We develop frameworks below for implementing meaningful participatory processes, but emphasize that these frameworks are procedural scaffolding that cannot substitute for genuine institutional commitment to sharing power with affected communities. Technical methods for stakeholder engagement will ring hollow unless accompanied by organizational changes that give stakeholders real authority over decisions affecting them.

## 20.4 Community-Based Participatory Research for Healthcare AI

Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an approach to research that emphasizes partnership between academic researchers and community members throughout the research process, from defining research questions through data collection and analysis to interpretation and dissemination of results (Israel et al., 1998; Wallerstein & Duran, 2006). CBPR recognizes community members as experts in their own experiences and contexts, with knowledge and perspectives essential for research that aims to improve community health. For healthcare AI development, CBPR principles offer a framework for meaningful engagement with underserved populations and marginalized communities rather than treating them merely as data sources or validation populations.

### 20.4.1 Principles of Community-Based Participatory Research

CBPR is guided by several core principles that distinguish it from traditional researcher-driven approaches. First, CBPR recognizes community as a unit of identity defined by members themselves rather than by geographic boundaries or demographic categories imposed by researchers. A community might be defined by shared neighborhood, shared identity such as racial or ethnic group, shared experience such as homelessness or refugee status, or shared values and social connections. Researchers do not define communities but rather engage with communities as they self-identify.

Second, CBPR builds on strengths and resources within communities rather than focusing solely on problems or deficits. This is particularly important for healthcare AI addressing health disparities, where deficit-framing risks portraying underserved populations as inherently problematic rather than as populations subjected to problematic structural conditions. A strength-based approach asks what assets and capabilities exist within communities that AI systems could help leverage rather than assuming communities lack capacity that researchers must supply.

Third, CBPR facilitates collaborative partnerships in all phases of research with shared decision-making authority and shared ownership of data and research products. This goes beyond advisory boards or focus groups that gather community input on researcher-defined agendas. True partnership means community members participate in formulating research questions, designing studies, interpreting results, and making decisions about how results are communicated and applied. For healthcare AI, this implies community participation in decisions about what outcomes to predict, what fairness metrics to optimize, and what deployment strategies to pursue.

Fourth, CBPR integrates knowledge and action for mutual benefit of all partners. Research is not purely extractive, generating knowledge that benefits researchers' careers while providing little value to communities. Instead, research aims to produce actionable knowledge that communities can use to improve health outcomes or advocate for policy changes. For healthcare AI, this implies that model development should address problems communities identify as priorities and should produce tools and knowledge that communities can use even if research findings are not publishable in high-impact journals.

Fifth, CBPR promotes co-learning and capacity building among all partners. Researchers learn from community expertise about local context, social determinants of health, and priorities for health improvement. Community members gain research skills and technical knowledge that can be applied beyond the specific project. For healthcare AI, co-learning might include researchers gaining understanding of how social factors affect health in ways not captured by clinical data, while community members gain understanding of AI capabilities and limitations that enables informed participation in oversight of deployed systems.

Sixth, CBPR emphasizes long-term commitment to sustaining partnerships beyond single projects. This is essential for building trust, particularly with communities that have experienced exploitation by researchers who extract data and then disappear. For healthcare AI, sustained partnerships enable ongoing monitoring and refinement of deployed systems, community feedback on model performance, and community participation in decisions about model updates or deployment of new systems.

Finally, CBPR involves a cyclical and iterative process that continually refines partnerships, research methods, and interventions based on experience. Rather than treating research as a linear progression from question to answer, CBPR recognizes that initial problem framings may need revision as deeper understanding develops, and that interventions may require modification as implementation reveals unforeseen barriers or unintended consequences. For healthcare AI, this iterative approach is particularly important because model performance and fairness properties can only be fully understood through deployment and monitoring in real-world conditions.

### 20.4.2 Applying CBPR Principles to Healthcare AI Development

Implementing CBPR principles in healthcare AI development requires adapting traditional AI development processes to accommodate shared decision-making, iterative refinement based on community feedback, and explicit attention to community priorities that may diverge from researcher or funder priorities. We outline key stages of participatory AI development below, recognizing that actual practice will vary depending on community context, available resources, and scope of the AI system being developed.

The first stage is community engagement and partnership formation before any technical work begins. This includes identifying appropriate community partners, which may be community-based organizations, patient advocacy groups, neighborhood associations, or informal community networks. Researchers should not unilaterally decide which communities to engage but rather follow existing relationships and be responsive to community invitations. Initial engagement focuses on mutual education, where researchers explain AI concepts and capabilities in accessible language while learning from community partners about health priorities, concerns about technology, and previous experiences with research institutions.

Partnership formation establishes formal agreements about roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, data ownership, and how benefits from research will be shared. These agreements should be negotiated rather than presented as standard contracts, recognizing that communities may have legitimate concerns about how their data will be used and who will benefit financially or professionally from research products. For healthcare AI, key issues include whether communities will have access to deployed systems, whether community members will be acknowledged as co-authors on publications, and what happens to models and data if partnerships end.

The second stage is participatory problem definition and priority setting. Rather than researchers identifying problems that AI might address and then seeking community input on solutions, CBPR begins by asking communities what health problems they view as priorities and what barriers they face in addressing those problems. The role of researchers is to help communities assess whether and how AI might be useful for addressing community-identified priorities, not to convince communities that researcher-identified problems are important.

This stage may reveal that AI is not the appropriate tool for addressing community priorities, or that social and policy interventions should take precedence over technological solutions. Communities may prioritize addressing social determinants such as housing instability or food insecurity over improving clinical care quality, leading to AI applications quite different from typical clinical prediction tasks. Communities may express concerns about surveillance or privacy that lead to choosing not to pursue certain AI applications even if technically feasible. Respecting community priorities even when they diverge from researcher interests is essential for genuine partnership.

The third stage is participatory model design and development. This includes community participation in decisions about what data to use, what outcomes to predict, what groups to examine when assessing fairness, and what constitutes acceptable model performance. Community members should be involved in reviewing training data for accuracy and relevance, as they may identify data quality issues or missing variables that researchers would overlook. Community input is essential for interpreting model predictions and ensuring that interventions triggered by predictions align with community values and are feasible in community contexts.

Technical barriers to meaningful community participation at this stage must be addressed through capacity building rather than by relegating community members to advisory roles on technical questions they do not understand. This may require investing substantial time in education about machine learning concepts, developing accessible visualizations of model behavior, and creating opportunities for hands-on experimentation where community members can see how changes to model design affect predictions for hypothetical patients. Some community members may develop substantial technical expertise through such processes, while others may focus on ensuring that technical choices align with community values even without deep technical understanding.

The fourth stage is participatory validation and evaluation. Community partners should be involved in defining what counts as acceptable model performance beyond standard technical metrics. This includes identifying potential harms or failure modes that technical evaluation might miss, assessing whether interventions triggered by model predictions are culturally appropriate and feasible, and evaluating whether model deployment affects community members' trust in healthcare systems. Community-based evaluation may reveal problems invisible in technical validation, such as models making predictions that are technically accurate but lead to stigmatizing labeling or increased surveillance of already over-surveilled communities.

The fifth stage is participatory deployment and monitoring. Community partners should participate in decisions about where and how models are deployed, what guardrails are needed to prevent misuse, and what triggers should prompt system shutdown or modification. Ongoing monitoring should include regular community review of model performance, community feedback mechanisms for reporting concerns about model behavior, and community participation in decisions about model updates. This recognizes that communities are best positioned to identify subtle changes in model behavior that may signal emerging problems, and that community trust in deployed systems depends on transparency and responsiveness to community concerns.

### 20.4.3 Challenges and Limitations of Participatory Approaches

While CBPR offers important advantages for ethical AI development, implementing these approaches faces substantial practical and ethical challenges that must be acknowledged. First, meaningful participation requires significant time and resources, for both researchers and community partners. Community members cannot be expected to volunteer substantial time without compensation, yet funding structures for AI research rarely budget adequately for community partner time. Multi-year partnerships needed for sustained engagement may not align with typical grant funding cycles or academic incentive structures that prioritize rapid publication.

Second, there are genuine tensions between participatory ideals and pressures for efficiency and scalability in AI development. Iterative design based on community feedback takes longer than researcher-driven development, potentially delaying deployment of beneficial systems. Moreover, deeply participatory processes for one community may not scale to many communities with diverse priorities and perspectives. If each deployment requires extended community engagement to adapt systems to local context, this may limit the reach of beneficial AI tools.

Third, communities are not homogeneous, and there may be disagreement within communities about priorities, acceptable trade-offs, and appropriate uses of AI. Participatory processes must grapple with internal community disagreement rather than seeking single community voice. This may require engaging diverse segments of communities including those most marginalized within communities, and accepting that some community members may support AI deployment while others oppose it.

Fourth, community priorities may sometimes conflict with broader public health goals or with needs of other communities. A community might prioritize AI tools that benefit their own members even if this comes at the expense of other underserved communities competing for limited resources. Participatory processes within one community cannot adjudicate fair distribution across communities, requiring additional processes for resolving inter-community allocation questions.

Fifth, there are questions about the appropriate scope of community decision authority. Should communities be able to veto research entirely, or only shape how research is conducted? Should community partners have authority over research results even when they conflict with investigator conclusions? These questions about epistemic authority and control over knowledge production are not easily resolved, particularly when community perspectives conflict with professional judgment of researchers or clinicians.

Despite these challenges, we argue that participatory approaches remain essential for ethical healthcare AI development, particularly for systems affecting underserved populations. The challenges identified above are reasons to carefully design participatory processes rather than reasons to abandon participation. We provide implementation frameworks below that address some practical challenges while acknowledging that no framework can fully resolve the inherent tensions between participatory ideals and other values including efficiency, consistency, and professional autonomy.

## 20.5 Systematic Benefit-Risk Analysis with Distributional Considerations

Healthcare AI systems create both benefits and risks whose magnitude and distribution must be carefully analyzed before deployment. Traditional benefit-risk analysis often focuses on aggregate expected utility, comparing overall benefits to overall risks without examining how benefits and risks are distributed across populations. For healthcare AI affecting underserved populations, distributional analysis is essential because systems that improve aggregate outcomes may nonetheless widen health disparities if benefits accrue primarily to already well-served populations while risks are concentrated among marginalized groups.

### 20.5.1 Framework for Distributional Benefit-Risk Analysis

We develop a systematic framework for analyzing benefits and risks of healthcare AI systems with explicit attention to distribution across populations. The framework proceeds through several stages, beginning with stakeholder identification and proceeding through benefit and risk enumeration, quantification where possible, distributional analysis, and synthesis into overall assessment that makes trade-offs explicit.

The first stage identifies all stakeholder groups who may be affected by the AI system, recognizing that benefits and risks may be distributed very differently across stakeholders. For a clinical risk prediction model, stakeholders include patients at whom predictions are directed, patients who are not identified as high-risk and therefore do not receive interventions, clinicians who use model outputs in their decision-making, healthcare organizations that deploy the model, payers whose coverage policies may be influenced by model predictions, and broader communities affected by how healthcare resources are allocated. Within each stakeholder category, further disaggregation may be needed to examine differential effects across demographic groups, clinical populations, or social positions.

The second stage enumerates potential benefits of the AI system for each stakeholder group. Benefits might include improved health outcomes through earlier detection of problems or more appropriate treatment selection, reduced healthcare costs through prevention of expensive acute care, improved efficiency allowing more patients to be served with existing resources, reduced clinician cognitive burden through automation of routine tasks, and enhanced patient engagement through better communication of health risks. The enumeration should be comprehensive rather than focusing only on primary intended benefits, as systems often have important secondary effects on groups beyond the primary target population.

The third stage enumerates potential risks and harms for each stakeholder group. Risks include direct harms from incorrect predictions leading to inappropriate clinical actions, such as false negatives that delay necessary treatment or false positives that lead to unnecessary procedures with associated risks. They also include dignitary harms from stigmatizing labeling or from being subjected to algorithmic decision-making without meaningful human involvement. Privacy risks arise from collection and use of sensitive health data. Autonomy harms occur when algorithmic systems constrain patient or clinician decision-making. And structural harms occur when systems reinforce or amplify existing inequities even if individual interactions are not overtly harmful.

The fourth stage quantifies benefits and risks where possible. Quantification enables comparisons and helps make trade-offs explicit, but many important benefits and risks resist meaningful quantification. Health benefits might be quantified in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained, deaths prevented, or hospital admissions averted. Efficiency benefits might be quantified as clinician time saved or cost reductions. Some risks such as false negative rates can be quantified probabilistically. But quantifying dignitary harms, privacy risks, or effects on patient trust in healthcare systems is much more difficult. The analysis should quantify what can be meaningfully quantified while acknowledging that not all considerations reduce to numbers.

The fifth stage examines how benefits and risks are distributed across populations. This is the critical step that distinguishes distributional analysis from aggregate analysis. For each enumerated benefit and risk, we examine whether magnitude differs across demographic groups, clinical subpopulations, care settings, or social positions. Statistical methods including stratified analysis and formal fairness metrics can help quantify disparities in benefits and risks. But quantitative disparities must be interpreted in light of historical context and background inequities to assess their ethical significance.

A simple example illustrates the importance of distributional analysis. Consider a clinical decision support system that reduces inappropriate antibiotic prescribing by twenty percent overall, generating substantial population health benefits by reducing antibiotic resistance. Stratified analysis reveals that the reduction is thirty percent for commercially insured patients but only ten percent for Medicaid patients, meaning the system's benefits are distributed unequally despite improving outcomes for both groups. Whether this unequal distribution is ethically acceptable depends on whether the inequality is justified by morally relevant differences between groups or represents unfair discrimination.

If Medicaid patients have more complex medical and social situations that make appropriate antibiotic use more difficult to determine even with decision support, the unequal benefit might be inherent to the different patient populations and not represent ethical failure of the system. However, if the disparity arises because the system was trained primarily on data from commercially insured patients and performs worse for Medicaid patients due to different documentation practices or different patterns of healthcare utilization, then the disparity represents an equity problem that should be addressed before deployment.

The sixth stage synthesizes findings into overall benefit-risk assessment that explicitly examines different distributional scenarios. Rather than reducing analysis to single recommendation, synthesis should present how assessment changes depending on what ethical principles are given priority. An analysis prioritizing aggregate utility will reach different conclusions than one prioritizing worst-off populations. Making these different perspectives explicit enables deliberation about which ethical framework is most appropriate for the particular decision context.

## 20.6 Case Studies: Ethical Successes and Failures in Healthcare AI

Learning from both successes and failures in healthcare AI deployment provides concrete illustrations of how ethical principles apply in practice and reveals patterns in what factors lead to ethical outcomes versus problematic ones. We examine three detailed case studies representing different types of ethical challenges, analyzing the technical, organizational, and social factors that led to observed outcomes.

### 20.6.1 Case Study: Pulse Oximetry and Algorithmic Failure in Medical Devices

Pulse oximetry provides a sobering case study of how seemingly straightforward measurement technologies can fail for underserved populations in ways that persist for decades before being recognized and addressed. Pulse oximeters estimate blood oxygen saturation noninvasively by measuring light absorption through skin. The devices were developed and validated primarily using data from individuals with light skin pigmentation. Recent research has documented that pulse oximeters systematically overestimate oxygen saturation in patients with darker skin, leading to missed diagnoses of hypoxemia that would have triggered clinical interventions (Sjoding et al., 2020).

The magnitude of this failure is substantial. Among hospitalized patients with measured oxygen saturation slightly above the threshold for supplemental oxygen, Black patients were three times more likely than white patients to have true hypoxemia undetected by pulse oximetry. This disparity translates to worse health outcomes, as timely oxygen supplementation can prevent organ damage from hypoxemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this issue gained heightened attention as pulse oximetry was widely used for home monitoring, with particular concern that racial disparities in pulse oximeter accuracy could contribute to disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.

From an ethical framework perspective, this case illustrates failure on multiple dimensions. The principle of non-maleficence was violated as Black patients experienced preventable harm from inaccurate measurements that delayed necessary treatment. Justice was violated as the benefits of pulse oximetry for monitoring and management of hypoxemia accrued disproportionately to white patients while risks of missed diagnoses were concentrated among Black patients. The capabilities approach reveals how this technological failure constrained the real capability of Black patients to receive accurate medical monitoring despite formal equal access to pulse oximetry.

The structural factors enabling this failure are instructive. Medical device development and validation has historically centered on white subjects, with inadequate representation of diverse patient populations in validation studies. Regulatory requirements from the Food and Drug Administration did not explicitly address performance across diverse skin tones when pulse oximeters were approved. Clinical practice guidelines were developed based on accuracy assumptions that did not hold across all populations. And the medical device industry faced minimal incentives to address the problem once devices were widely deployed, as market competition focused on price and features rather than equitable performance.

The pulse oximetry case also illustrates how technical failures can interact with social determinants to amplify health disparities. Black patients are more likely to have chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that require oxygen monitoring, meaning pulse oximeter inaccuracy affects a population already experiencing disproportionate burden of respiratory disease. Black patients are less likely to have insurance coverage for home oxygen equipment, making accurate assessment of oxygen needs more critical for appropriate resource allocation. And Black patients report higher rates of dismissal of their symptoms by medical providers, making objective measurement tools particularly important for ensuring their concerns are taken seriously.

Several interventions could have prevented or mitigated this ethical failure. Inclusive validation studies that explicitly assessed pulse oximeter accuracy across diverse skin tones would have revealed the problem before widespread deployment. Regulatory requirements for disaggregated performance reporting could have made disparities visible and created market incentives to address them. Clinical practice guidelines could have acknowledged uncertainty in pulse oximetry measurements for certain populations and recommended lower treatment thresholds or arterial blood gas confirmation. And post-market surveillance could have detected performance disparities through analysis of clinical outcomes data.

The pulse oximetry case has implications for healthcare AI development more broadly. Like pulse oximeters, AI systems are often developed and validated using data that underrepresent marginalized populations, creating risk of disparate performance that may not be detected until after widespread deployment. Like pulse oximeters, AI systems become embedded in clinical workflows and referenced in practice guidelines, making problematic systems difficult to dislodge even after problems are identified. And like pulse oximeters, AI systems interact with social determinants and pre-existing disparities in ways that can amplify rather than reduce inequities. The lesson is that technical performance in development populations does not guarantee equitable performance across deployment populations, and that systematic attention to equity must be built into development, validation, and monitoring processes from the outset.

### 20.6.2 Case Study: Kidney Function Estimation and Race-Based Medicine

For decades, clinical laboratories in the United States reported estimated glomerular filtration rate values that incorporated race as a variable, with equations yielding higher estimated kidney function for Black patients than white patients with identical measured creatinine levels. This practice, embedded in clinical decision support systems and laboratory information systems, had profound consequences for Black patients. Higher estimated kidney function delayed diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, delayed referrals for nephrology consultation, and made Black patients less likely to qualify for kidney transplant wait lists or to receive priority for transplantation (Vyas et al., 2020).

The inclusion of race in kidney function estimation reflected historical assumptions that Black individuals have higher muscle mass and therefore produce more creatinine for the same level of kidney function. However, this biological essentialist reasoning conflates race as a social category with purported genetic differences in metabolism. Within racialized groups, there is enormous heterogeneity in muscle mass, diet, and other factors affecting creatinine production. Moreover, the decision to adjust estimated kidney function upward for Black patients but not for other groups with similar or greater average muscle mass revealed that the adjustment was based on racial categorization rather than physiological differences.

From an ethical framework perspective, the race-based kidney function equation violated the principle of justice by systematically disadvantaging Black patients in access to treatments for kidney disease. It violated the capabilities approach by constraining Black patients' capability to receive timely diagnosis and treatment. And it exemplified structural injustice by embedding racial bias in technical algorithms that then shaped clinical decisions across thousands of healthcare settings.

The factors that enabled this failure are revealing. The original derivation of race-adjusted equations used datasets that underrepresented Black patients, meaning that statistical adjustments were based on limited data about the population they were meant to describe. The equations were adopted rapidly and widely without adequate validation across diverse Black populations, creating path dependence where problematic standards became difficult to change once embedded in systems. Clinical laboratories and EHR vendors implemented the equations without providing options for race-free estimation, leaving individual clinicians unable to opt out even when they recognized problems. And medical specialty societies initially defended the race-adjusted equations despite growing evidence of harm, illustrating how professional and institutional interests can impede recognition of ethical problems.

Advocacy from patients, community organizations, and clinicians working in nephrology eventually led to reexamination of race-based kidney function estimation. Multiple professional societies convened task forces that recommended eliminating race from estimation equations, and new race-free equations were developed and validated (Delgado et al., 2021). Implementation of race-free equations has been uneven, with some health systems transitioning rapidly while others have been slower to change embedded practices. This illustrates the importance of mechanisms for identifying and correcting ethical problems in deployed systems.

Several lessons emerge from this case study for healthcare AI development. First, inclusion of demographic variables such as race in prediction models requires rigorous justification and consideration of whether inclusion reflects biological necessity or instead encodes social determinants or structural racism. Second, once problematic practices become embedded in clinical workflows and systems, changing them requires coordinated effort across multiple stakeholders and may face resistance from institutions with interests in maintaining current practice. Third, community advocacy and organizing by affected populations play essential roles in identifying ethical problems and driving change. And fourth, professional societies and regulatory bodies have responsibility for setting standards that prevent encoding bias in clinical algorithms and for revisiting those standards as understanding of equity issues evolves.

### 20.6.3 Case Study: Community-Engaged Development of Maternal Health AI

In contrast to the failures illustrated by pulse oximetry and kidney function estimation, some healthcare AI development efforts have successfully centered equity and meaningful community engagement. One illustrative case involves development of predictive models for maternal health complications in Chicago, where a community-academic partnership used CBPR principles to develop and deploy AI tools that aimed to reduce persistent racial disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity (Howell et al., 2020).

Black women in the United States experience maternal mortality at rates three to four times higher than white women, with disparities persisting across socioeconomic levels and geographic regions. In Chicago, community organizations representing Black women had long advocated for interventions to address maternal health disparities, emphasizing the roles of structural racism, inadequate prenatal care, and dismissal of Black women's symptoms by healthcare providers. When researchers proposed developing AI systems to predict maternal complications and trigger preventive interventions, community organizations insisted on meaningful partnership throughout the development process rather than being relegated to advisory roles.

The partnership established formal agreements about shared decision-making authority, data governance, and how benefits from the research would be shared. Community partners participated in defining research questions, with the research agenda ultimately focusing on predicting which women would benefit most from doula support and enhanced postpartum monitoring rather than simply predicting which women were highest risk for complications. This reframing reflected community insight that risk prediction alone would not address underlying causes of disparities and might lead to increased surveillance of Black women without improving care quality.

Community members participated in reviewing training data and identifying variables that should and should not be included in models. This process revealed that many clinical risk factors in EHR data were actually markers of inadequate prenatal care or healthcare system failures rather than inherent patient characteristics. For example, late entry into prenatal care is a strong predictor of maternal complications, but community partners emphasized that this variable reflects barriers to care access rather than patient neglect and should not be used to deprioritize women for support services. Similarly, history of substance use was identified as a variable that could lead to stigmatization and removal of children rather than appropriate medical support.

Model development proceeded with explicit fairness constraints requiring that false negative rates be equalized across racial groups even at the expense of overall accuracy. This decision reflected community partners' insistence that no group should systematically miss out on potentially life-saving interventions. The models were validated not just through traditional statistical methods but through community review of predictions, with community members assessing whether predicted needs for support matched their understanding of women's circumstances.

Deployment included ongoing community monitoring of model performance and regular meetings where community partners could raise concerns about model behavior or request modifications. When early monitoring revealed that the model was underidentifying Spanish-speaking women for doula support despite their being at high risk, community partners advocated for enhanced outreach protocols that supplemented algorithmic predictions with community health worker assessments. This adaptive approach prevented the model from becoming a fixed system that might perpetuate disparities as populations or care practices changed.

The community-engaged approach yielded several benefits beyond the immediate maternal health outcomes. Community partners gained technical knowledge and capacity to engage with other AI systems affecting their communities. Researchers developed richer understanding of social determinants and structural factors affecting maternal health that informed their subsequent work. The healthcare system implementing the model developed institutional capacity for community engagement that extended to other quality improvement efforts. And the partnership produced case study materials that have been used to train other AI developers in participatory approaches.

This case study illustrates several success factors for ethical healthcare AI development. Meaningful community partnership from project inception rather than token consultation after key decisions were made. Willingness to adapt technical approaches and performance metrics based on community input even when this conflicted with technical optimization. Explicit attention to power dynamics and commitment to sharing decision authority with community partners. Long-term commitment to sustained partnership that enabled trust building and iterative refinement. And institutional support from academic and healthcare system leadership that valued equity outcomes alongside traditional research productivity metrics.

The maternal health case also illustrates remaining challenges even in well-designed participatory processes. The intensive engagement required is resource-intensive and may be difficult to sustain without dedicated funding. Community partners may experience burnout from extensive participation requirements. Tensions between community priorities and funder or institutional priorities require ongoing negotiation. And scaling participatory approaches to multiple communities with diverse perspectives requires processes for resolving inter-community disagreements.

## 20.7 Structured Frameworks for Ethical Deliberation

Healthcare AI development inevitably involves trade-offs between competing values where no option satisfies all ethical principles and stakeholder interests. Structured deliberation frameworks cannot resolve these tensions, but they can make the ethical considerations explicit, ensure diverse perspectives are considered, and support defensible decision-making processes even when outcomes remain contested. We present a comprehensive framework for ethical deliberation adapted from technology ethics literature and bioethics consultation practices.

### 20.7.1 Stage-Gate Model for Ethics Integration

Rather than treating ethics as a final check before deployment, ethical deliberation should be integrated throughout the AI development lifecycle. We propose a stage-gate model where specific ethical assessments occur at defined points with explicit criteria for proceeding to the next development stage. This approach treats ethical considerations as essential rather than optional and prevents problematic systems from progressing too far before issues are identified.

The first gate is problem definition and justification, occurring before any technical work begins. Deliberation at this stage addresses whether AI is an appropriate intervention for the identified problem, whether the problem framing reflects affected communities' priorities, whether pursuing AI solutions might crowd out other interventions that could be more effective for equity, and who has participated in defining the problem and what perspectives may be missing. Exit criteria for this gate include documented justification for pursuing AI approaches, evidence of stakeholder input on problem definition, and preliminary assessment that AI development aligns with community health priorities.

The second gate is data assessment and bias evaluation, occurring after training data have been assembled but before model development begins. Deliberation addresses the provenance of training data and any known biases in data collection, representation of diverse populations in training data, inclusion of variables that may encode discrimination, and fairness implications of using particular data sources or excluding others. Exit criteria include documented assessment of data quality and representativeness across populations, identification of potential sources of bias in training data, and plans for how identified biases will be addressed in modeling.

The third gate is model design and fairness specification, occurring after initial model architectures have been selected but before extensive training and optimization. Deliberation addresses what outcomes the model should predict and whether those outcomes align with health equity goals, what fairness criteria the model should satisfy and whose perspectives shaped that selection, what groups should be examined in fairness assessments, and how trade-offs between aggregate performance and equitable performance will be handled. Exit criteria include explicit documentation of fairness constraints and metrics, stakeholder agreement on fairness priorities, and preliminary fairness evaluation showing the approach is feasible.

The fourth gate is validation and equity assessment, occurring after models have been developed but before deployment. Deliberation addresses performance across diverse populations and care settings, error patterns and failure modes with particular attention to equity implications, whether models perform adequately for smallest and most vulnerable populations, and what safeguards are needed to prevent misuse or to catch errors before they cause harm. Exit criteria include comprehensive validation evidence including subgroup analyses, identification of populations or contexts where model performance is inadequate, and documented plans for how performance limitations will be communicated and addressed in deployment.

The fifth gate is deployment planning and impact assessment, occurring before models enter clinical use. Deliberation addresses how models will be integrated into clinical workflows, what training and support clinicians and patients will receive, how model use will be monitored for equity issues, and what triggers will prompt model modification or shutdown. Exit criteria include detailed deployment protocols that address equity considerations, training materials tested with representative end-users, and monitoring systems with explicit equity metrics ready for activation.

The sixth gate is ongoing monitoring and reassessment, occurring continuously after deployment. Deliberation addresses whether model performance is consistent with validation expectations, whether new equity issues have emerged as populations or practices change, whether stakeholders remain satisfied with model behavior, and whether models should be modified or retired. Exit criteria for continuing deployment include sustained equitable performance across populations, absence of serious reported equity concerns, and regular stakeholder review confirming the model continues to align with community values.

### 20.7.2 Ethical Deliberation Protocol

Within each gate, structured protocols guide deliberation to ensure comprehensive consideration of ethical issues. We present a deliberation protocol that can be adapted to different organizational contexts and scales of AI projects. The protocol proceeds through problem analysis, stakeholder perspective gathering, ethical principles application, option generation, comparative assessment, and decision documentation.

Problem analysis begins with clear articulation of the ethical question or trade-off requiring deliberation. Questions should be framed to make values explicit rather than disguising ethical questions as purely technical ones. For example, instead of asking what fairness metric to optimize, frame the question as what constitutes fair treatment across groups given this model's purpose and deployment context. Instead of asking whether model performance is adequate, ask whether the magnitude of performance disparities across groups is ethically acceptable given available alternatives.

Stakeholder perspective gathering ensures that deliberation incorporates views from everyone affected by the decision. This goes beyond representation to genuine engagement with diverse stakeholder perspectives on what is at stake ethically. Methods include structured interviews or focus groups with patients, clinicians, community members, and other stakeholders, review of relevant advocacy literature and community position statements, consultation with bioethics experts and community advisory boards, and examination of how similar issues have been addressed in comparable contexts. The goal is not to achieve consensus but to ensure decision-makers understand the range of legitimate perspectives and their rationales.

Ethical principles application examines how different ethical frameworks evaluate the options. This includes analyzing options through the lens of principlist bioethics examining autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice implications, applying capabilities approach to assess whether options expand or constrain capabilities of diverse populations, considering structural justice questions about whether options challenge or reinforce inequitable patterns, examining implications from different theories of distributive justice including utilitarian, prioritarian, and egalitarian perspectives, and assessing whether options are consistent with human rights frameworks and requirements for dignity and non-discrimination.

Option generation brainstorms possible approaches including creative alternatives that may not have been initially considered. Rather than treating options as binary accept-or-reject decisions, deliberation should explore modifications that might address ethical concerns. Can fairness constraints be tightened? Can deployment be restricted to contexts where performance is most equitable? Can additional safeguards mitigate identified risks? Can complementary interventions address root causes of disparities rather than working around them algorithmically? Generating diverse options requires creative thinking and willingness to reconsider technical or organizational constraints that may not be as fixed as initially assumed.

Comparative assessment systematically evaluates options against ethical criteria and stakeholder priorities. This includes tabulating benefits and burdens of each option across stakeholder groups, examining how options perform against different ethical principles recognizing that no option will be optimal across all frameworks, identifying which stakeholders would bear greatest burdens and whether this is justifiable, assessing uncertainty in predictions about outcomes and how this uncertainty affects ethical evaluation, and considering precedent-setting effects where accepting certain trade-offs may establish patterns for future decisions. Comparative assessment makes trade-offs explicit rather than leaving them implicit in technical optimizations.

Decision documentation records the deliberation process and rationale for conclusions reached. Documentation should include the ethical question or trade-off deliberated, who participated in deliberation and what perspectives they represented, what ethical frameworks and principles were applied, what options were considered and how they were evaluated, what decision was reached and why that option was chosen, what dissenting views remained and how they were addressed, what uncertainties remain and how they will be monitored, and what triggers would prompt revisiting the decision. Comprehensive documentation serves accountability functions, enables organizational learning, and supports transparency with affected stakeholders about how decisions were made.

## 20.8 Conclusion: Ethics as Ongoing Practice

This chapter has developed frameworks for ethical analysis of healthcare AI systems, with particular focus on how AI can advance or undermine health equity for underserved populations. We have examined established ethical frameworks from bioethics and political philosophy, adapted them to address unique challenges of algorithmic decision-making, developed participatory processes for meaningful stakeholder engagement, created methods for distributional benefit-risk analysis, and provided structured deliberation frameworks for navigating tensions between competing values.

Several key principles emerge from this analysis. First, technical solutions alone cannot ensure ethical AI because fundamental questions about fairness, justice, and appropriate use of prediction in clinical care require value judgments that cannot be resolved through optimization algorithms. Every technical choice encodes ethical assumptions whether explicitly acknowledged or not, and making these assumptions transparent is essential for accountability.

Second, ethical AI requires meaningful participation of affected communities throughout the development lifecycle rather than token consultation after key decisions have been made. Communities have essential expertise about their own health priorities, about social factors affecting health, and about what constitutes acceptable trade-offs between different goods. Participatory processes that genuinely share decision authority rather than merely seeking input are necessary though not sufficient for ethical AI.

Third, aggregate assessments of AI system performance can obscure disparate impacts across populations. Distributional analysis examining how benefits and risks are allocated is essential for evaluating whether systems advance or undermine health equity. Systems that improve aggregate outcomes while widening disparities for marginalized groups represent ethical failures even if technically sophisticated and beneficial for some.

Fourth, healthcare AI development occurs within structures and institutions that systematically advantage certain populations while disadvantaging others. These structural factors shape what kinds of AI systems get developed, whose priorities they serve, and who bears risks when systems fail. Addressing structural injustice requires not just fixing bias in particular systems but examining and changing the background conditions that produce patterns of inequitable AI development.

Fifth, reasonable people with different values will reach different conclusions about what constitutes ethical AI even when working from the same empirical evidence. These disagreements often reflect legitimate differences in ethical priorities rather than factual misunderstandings. Ethical deliberation frameworks cannot eliminate disagreement but can ensure that disagreements are surfaced early, taken seriously, and resolved through defensible processes that respect moral agency of affected stakeholders.

Finally, ethical analysis is not a one-time assessment but an ongoing practice that must continue throughout the model lifecycle. Ethical issues evolve as systems are deployed in new contexts, as patient populations change, as understanding of fairness and justice develops, and as social and political conditions shift. Mechanisms for ongoing monitoring, stakeholder feedback, and revision of decisions are essential for sustained ethical AI.

These principles have profound implications for AI development practice. They require allocating substantial time and resources to ethical deliberation and stakeholder engagement rather than treating ethics as a box to check before deployment. They require developing organizational cultures and governance structures that support meaningful participation and accountability. They require training AI developers in ethical reasoning and social determinants of health alongside technical skills. They require creating incentives for equity-focused AI research even when such research is more challenging technically or less rewarded professionally than standard approaches. And they require sustained commitment from institutions and leaders to prioritize health equity even when this conflicts with organizational interests in efficiency, cost reduction, or competitive advantage.

The frameworks and tools provided in this chapter offer starting points for operationalizing these principles, but they are not recipes that guarantee ethical outcomes if followed mechanically. Ethical AI development requires judgment, humility, and willingness to grapple with difficult trade-offs where no perfect solution exists. It requires recognizing that developers and institutions have limited perspectives and must actively seek out and genuinely engage with perspectives of communities most affected by AI systems. It requires acknowledging uncertainty about how systems will behave in deployment and building in safeguards and monitoring systems accordingly. And it requires accepting that some development efforts should not proceed if adequate equitable performance cannot be achieved or if participatory processes reveal that communities do not want the proposed systems.

The goal is not to develop AI systems that satisfy all stakeholders and resolve all tensions between competing values, which is generally impossible. Rather, the goal is to develop AI systems through processes that are ethical, transparent, inclusive, and accountable, where stakeholders understand what trade-offs have been made and why, where mechanisms exist for detecting and addressing problems, and where affected communities have meaningful voice in shaping systems affecting their health. Healthcare AI developed according to these principles may still face challenges and criticism, but it will be substantially more likely to advance rather than undermine health equity for underserved populations.
