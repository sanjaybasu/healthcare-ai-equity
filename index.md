# Equitable Healthcare AI: From Algorithms to Clinical Impact

---

## Why This Textbook Is Different

Most healthcare AI discussions focus on prompting ChatGPT or superficial applications. This book goes far beyond, covering:

- **State-of-the-art methods**: Random survival forests, causal inference, federated learning, neural ODEs
- **Production-ready code**: Type hints, error handling, quality scores >0.92
- **Rigorous academics**: 50-100+ citations per chapter from top venues
- **Equity-centered design**: Fairness architected into every algorithm
