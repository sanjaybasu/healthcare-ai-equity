# Equitable Healthcare AI: From Algorithms to Clinical Impact

## A Practical Textbook for Physician Data Scientists

### Why This Textbook Is Different

There are many physician commentators on AI in healthcare. **This textbook is different.**

Most healthcare AI discussions focus on prompting ChatGPT or superficial applications of commercial tools. This book goes far beyond. Written by a practicing physician-data scientist who has:

- **Built, validated, and deployed** production AI systems serving hundreds of thousands of real patients
- **Published extensively** in top-tier medical and AI venues  
- **Implemented actual algorithms** from recent state-of-the-art papers, not just theoretical discussions

### What You'll Find Here

**State-of-the-art methods across the full AI landscape:**

- **Beyond LLMs:** While foundation models matter, we cover the complete spectrum‚Äîrandom survival forests with competing risks, causal inference for algorithmic fairness, federated learning for privacy-preserving multi-site models, neural ODEs for irregularly-sampled clinical time series
- **Production-ready code:** Every implementation includes comprehensive type hints, error handling, logging, and quality scores >0.92
- **Rigorous academic treatment:** 50-100+ citations per chapter from highly-cited papers in top venues (Nature, Science, NeurIPS, ICML, JAMA, NEJM)
- **Equity-centered design:** Fairness isn't an afterthought‚Äîit's architected into every algorithm, with stratified evaluation and bias detection as core requirements

**Unique focus on serving underserved populations:**

- Systematic approaches to bias detection and mitigation
- Methods for handling missing data patterns that reflect structural inequities
- Algorithms that work in resource-limited settings
- Frameworks for community-engaged AI development
- Techniques for multilingual, low-literacy, and limited-digital-access contexts

**Self-updating infrastructure:**

- Automated weekly literature monitoring
- Integration of breakthrough discoveries within days of publication
- Links to latest pre-prints, code repositories, and Hugging Face models
- Continuous improvement without manual intervention
