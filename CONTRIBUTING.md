   - Explain rationale and approach
   - Get feedback before implementing

### 2. Making Changes

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork your-username/healthcare-ai-textbook
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing style and conventions
   - Test locally before committing
   - Write clear commit messages

4. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   # Check http://localhost:4000
   ```

### 3. Submitting Changes

1. **Commit changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add causal inference section to Chapter 11"
   ```
   
   **Commit message format:**
   - `feat:` New feature or content
   - `fix:` Bug fix or correction
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `style:` Formatting, no code change
   - `refactor:` Code restructuring
   - `test:` Adding tests
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

2. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Describe changes clearly
   - Reference related issues
   - Request review from maintainers

## ‚úÖ Review Process

### What We Look For

**Content Quality:**
- Technical accuracy
- Clinical relevance
- Equity considerations
- Appropriate citations
- Clear explanations

**Code Quality:**
- Follows Python best practices
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-documented
- Type hints included
- Passes quality checks

**Documentation:**
- Clear and concise
- Follows existing style
- No broken links
- Proper formatting

### Review Timeline

- Initial review: Within 7 days
- Feedback cycles: As needed
- Merge decision: Based on maintainer consensus

## üìê Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Tone:** Academic but accessible
- **Audience:** Healthcare data scientists and physician-researchers
- **Person:** Use "we" for authors, "you" for readers
- **Length:** Comprehensive but concise
- **Examples:** Always include clinical context

### Code Style

Follow PEP 8 with these additions:

```python
# Type hints required
def process_data(
    df: pd.DataFrame,
    column: str,
    threshold: float = 0.5
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Docstring required for all functions."""
    pass

# Comprehensive error handling
try:
    result = compute_metric(data)
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid input: {e}")
    raise
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise

# Logging for key operations
logger.info(f"Processing {len(df)} records")
logger.debug(f"Parameters: threshold={threshold}")
```

### Citation Style

Use JMLR format:

```
Author, A., Author, B., & Author, C. (Year).
Title of paper.
*Journal Name*, Volume(Issue), Page-Range.
https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx
```

Example:
```
Obermeyer, Z., Powers, B., Vogeli, C., & Mullainathan, S. (2019).
Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations.
*Science*, 366(6464), 447-453.
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax2342
```

## üî¨ Chapter-Specific Guidelines

### Adding New Sections

Each chapter should maintain:

1. **Learning Objectives** - Clear, measurable goals
2. **Introduction** - Clinical context and equity framing
3. **Technical Content** - Rigorous mathematical treatment
4. **Implementation** - Production-ready code
5. **Fairness Evaluation** - Explicit bias detection and mitigation
6. **Case Studies** - Real-world examples
7. **Summary** - Key takeaways
8. **Bibliography** - Comprehensive citations

### Code Examples

All code must include:

- Complete, runnable examples
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints
- Error handling
- Logging
- Fairness evaluation components
- Comments explaining equity considerations

### Equity Integration

Every technical section must address:

- How does this method affect different populations?
- What biases might it introduce or amplify?
- How can we detect and mitigate disparities?
- What are the equity implications of deployment?

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome diverse perspectives
- Assume good intent
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Center the voices of affected communities

### Communication

- Use clear, professional language
- Be patient with questions

- Acknowledge contributions
- Cite sources appropriately

### Conflict Resolution

If disagreements arise:

1. Discuss respectfully in issue/PR
